$investigate  I'm noticing that a few directories have many repeats of lowercase s ship skills? And other skills too. Our skills installed via the npm package are upper case and so I'm not sure how we would clear that up. It's consuming context space having those repeated skills

# Investigate

Invoke as `$investigate`.

Use this skill when the user reports a bug, error, unexpected behavior, or provides observations/hypotheses about what they think is wrong. Validates claims against the codebase and git history before tracing to root cause.

## Process

1. Parse the error message, stack trace, bug description, or user observations/claims.
2. **Select investigation strategy** from flags or auto-detection:
   - `--ui`: Visual/layout bugs — start from component tree, styles, animations, transitions, spacing, theming, skeleton/loading states, positioning. Signal words: skeleton, animation, spacing, popover, transition, theme, truncated, glitch, dead space, detached, pop-in, flickering, layout, z-index, overflow.
   - `--data`: Data/state bugs — start from data pipeline, state management, timers, counters, sync logic. Signal words: countdown, percentage, usage, sync, stale, timer, refresh, reset, missing data, wrong number, out of sync, not updating, mismatch.
   - General (default): Errors, crashes, behavioral bugs, and anything ambiguous — start from symptom/stack trace.
   - If input has signals from both UI and data, prefer data strategy — wrong data commonly manifests as a visual symptom.
3. If the user provides claims or hypotheses, validate each one against the codebase and git history (`git log`, `git diff`, `git blame`). Classify each as confirmed, partially correct, or not supported by evidence. Report findings before proceeding.
4. Trace using the selected strategy:
   - **UI**: component tree → styles → layout → animation/transition → render lifecycle. Check CSS conflicts, missing keys, layout thrashing, transition timing.
   - **Data**: data source → transform → store → subscription → render. Check stale closures, missing dependency arrays, incorrect comparisons, cache invalidation, timer drift.
   - **General**: execution path from symptom to source — null/undefined, wrong types, missing env vars, stale imports, race conditions, schema mismatches.
   - If the initial strategy hits a dead end, pivot to the other — a UI bug may have a data root cause, and vice versa.
5. Check recent git history for changes that may have introduced the issue.
6. Identify the root cause with file and line reference.
7. Apply a minimal fix and write or update tests.
8. Run tests to verify the fix and check for regressions.

## Output

- **Strategy Used**: UI / Data / General (auto-detected or flag-forced), whether a pivot occurred
- **User Claims Validated**: For each claim — verdict (confirmed/partially correct/not supported) and evidence. Skip if input was a plain error message.
- **Root Cause**: file:line, what's wrong, when introduced, relationship to user's theory
- **Fix Applied**: files modified, test results
- **Prevention**: what check would have caught this earlier

## Constraints

- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Validate user claims before assuming they're correct — observations are a starting point, not ground truth.
- If the root cause can't be determined, report what was ruled out.
- Always run tests after applying the fix.
