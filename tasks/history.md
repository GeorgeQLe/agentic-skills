# Session History

## 2026-05-12 — Step 39.2: Add benchmark results surface to Skills Showcase UI

- Created `/benchmarks` page with server-rendered shell and client component rendering an aggregated benchmark results table (Skill, Status, Agent, Pass Rate, Quality, Date, Report).
- Extracted shared TypeScript interfaces into `src/showcase/types.ts` from `catalog.tsx`.
- Made "benchmark-passed" tag chip link to `/benchmarks` in catalog view.
- Added "Benchmarks" nav link to header and mobile panel; added route to `routes.ts`.
- Added benchmark table CSS, badge styles (graded/partial), and tag-link styles.
- Created 10 tests in `benchmarks.test.tsx` and 1 smoke test; updated routes test count to 8.
- Regenerated showcase data and proof data.
- All 85 showcase tests pass, 1304 layer1 tests pass, Next.js build succeeds.

## 2026-05-12 — Phase 38 milestone review and phase transition

- Verified all 11 Phase 38 acceptance criteria: tRPC subscribe mutation, Neon schema fields, idempotent duplicates, error UI states, admin secret gate, admin list/search/copy/CSV, privacy test, 74/74 tests passing, typecheck clean, whitespace clean, no GitHub Actions.
- Archived Phase 38 to `tasks/phases/phase-38.md` with completion notes.
- Updated roadmap summary (38 complete, 1 planned).
- Advanced `tasks/todo.md` to Phase 39: Benchmark Results Visibility And Safe Git Fixtures.

## 2026-05-12 — Step 38.9: Local app validation (no-op)

- Typecheck, build, 73/73 tests, `git diff --check` all passed during Step 38.8 session.
- Showcase data validated; stale docs copy is from pre-existing benchmark demo scaffolding, not newsletter work.
- No fixes needed. Marked complete as no-op.

## 2026-05-12 — Step 38.8: Write regression tests for newsletter capture and admin

- Created `src/showcase/admin-newsletter.test.tsx`: 7 tests covering login gate (renders, submit, error, pending) and admin view (table, empty state, search, buttons).
- Created `src/trpc/newsletter.test.ts`: 10 tests covering subscribe (valid, Zod rejection, DB error), adminLogin (correct/wrong/missing secret), adminList (auth gate, authenticated list), adminExport (CSV with escaping, auth gate).
- Updated `src/showcase/routes.test.ts`: added privacy check scanning public assets for subscriber data patterns.
- Validation: typecheck clean, 73/73 tests pass.

## 2026-05-12 — Step 38.7: Update deploy contract, routes, and documentation

- Updated `tasks/deploy.md`: replaced static export/no-database language with server-side Node.js + Neon PostgreSQL, added env vars section, updated route list with `/admin/newsletter` and `/api/trpc/*`, removed stale Newsletter Provider section, updated launch checks.
- Updated `apps/skills-showcase/src/showcase/routes.ts`: added `/admin/newsletter` route, updated `/follow` description.
- Updated `apps/skills-showcase/README.md`: added Environment Variables and Database sections.
- Updated `routes.test.ts`: route count 6→7, added admin route/label assertions.
- Fixed `smoke.test.tsx`: corrected stale "Explore the Library" → "Explore the Map" assertion.
- Verified: typecheck clean, build passing, 52/52 showcase tests green.

## 2026-05-12 — Step 38.6: Create admin newsletter page with secret-based auth gate

- Created `app/admin/newsletter/page.tsx`: server component shell with noindex metadata.
- Created `src/showcase/admin-newsletter.tsx`: client component with login gate (`adminLogin` mutation), subscriber table with search (`adminList` query), copy-active-emails to clipboard, CSV download (`adminExport` query). Styled with existing showcase classes.
- Validation: typecheck, build, 52/52 tests, `git diff --check` clean.

## 2026-05-12 — Step 38.2: Create database schema, connection module, and migration SQL

- Created `src/db/schema.ts`: `NewsletterSubscriber` interface, `SubscriberStatus` type union.
- Created `src/db/index.ts`: `getDb()` Neon connection (reads `DATABASE_URL` at call time), `insertSubscriber` (upsert on email conflict), `findSubscriberByEmail`, `listSubscribers` (with ILIKE search, pagination), `exportSubscribers` (active only).
- Created `src/db/migrate.sql`: idempotent DDL with uuid PK, two indexes (status, created_at desc).
- Validation: typecheck, build, 54/54 tests, `git diff --check` clean.

## 2026-05-12 — Step 38.1: Add Phase 38 dependencies and configure environment

- Added 6 runtime dependencies to `apps/skills-showcase/package.json`: `@trpc/server`, `@trpc/client`, `@trpc/react-query` ^11.17.0, `@tanstack/react-query` ^5, `@neondatabase/serverless` ^1, `zod` ^4.
- Created `apps/skills-showcase/.env.example` with `DATABASE_URL` and `NEWSLETTER_ADMIN_SECRET` placeholders.
- Confirmed `next.config.mjs` has no `output: "export"` — compatible with API routes.
- Validation: typecheck, build, 54/54 tests, showcase data fresh, `git diff --check` clean.

## 2026-05-12 — Ad-Hoc: YouTube Concept Research Skill

- Added mirrored `youtube-concept-research` skill to `youtube-ops` pack (Claude + Codex).
- Updated PACK.md flow and skill list. Updated next-skill routing across all youtube-ops and creator-foundation skills.
- Benchmark rerun results recorded for `benchmark-test-skill`.

## 2026-05-12 — Phase 37 Complete: Skills Showcase Next.js Preservation Refactor

- Completed Step 37.8: local app validation and whitespace checks. Regenerated stale data assets.
- All 5 validation commands pass, 54/54 app tests, 1256/1256 layer1 tests.
- Phase 37 milestone fully met (all 9 criteria). Archived to `tasks/phases/phase-37.md`.
- Non-blocking manual tasks remain: Vercel project setup and newsletter provider config.

## 2026-05-12 — Step 37.7 Regression tests for showcase app

- Added Vitest + @testing-library/react + jsdom test infrastructure to `apps/skills-showcase`.
- Created Next.js module mocks for jsdom (`next/link`, `next/navigation`, `next/script`).
- Wrote 54 tests across 5 files: routes (7), catalog (17), workflows (11), newsletter-form (9), smoke rendering (8).
- All tests pass, typecheck clean.

## 2026-05-12 — Step 37.6 Retire old static-site surface

- Deleted 8 static site files (HTML/CSS/JS) from `docs/skills-showcase/`. Kept `docs/skills-showcase/assets/` for dual-write.
- Updated `docs/skills-reference.md`, `tasks/deploy.md`, and `apps/skills-showcase/README.md` to remove compatibility language and mark Next.js app as sole showcase surface.
- Regenerated stale github-proof-data. Validator passes, build produces 6 routes.

## 2026-05-12 — Step 37.5 Deployment and local operation documentation

- Updated `docs/skills-reference.md` "Skills Showcase Freshness" section to document dual-write paths and mark the Next.js app as primary.
- Rewrote `tasks/deploy.md` deploy contract with Next.js app as primary target and legacy static site as compatibility section.
- Created `apps/skills-showcase/README.md` with local dev/build, data freshness validation, and relationship to `docs/skills-showcase/`.
- Regenerated stale github-proof-data. Validator passes, no whitespace issues.

## 2026-05-12 — Step 37.4 Generated data pipeline for Next.js app

- Updated `scripts/generate-skills-showcase-data.mjs` and `scripts/generate-skills-showcase-github-data.mjs` to dual-write to both `docs/skills-showcase/assets/` (compatibility) and `apps/skills-showcase/public/assets/` (Next.js app).
- Updated `scripts/validate-skills-showcase-data.sh` to fingerprint all four generated assets (old + new paths).
- Added `<Script strategy="beforeInteractive">` tags in root `app/layout.tsx` to load `skills-data.js` and `github-proof-data.js` before React hydration.
- Verified: generators produce both outputs, validator passes, build produces 6 static routes, dev server serves data assets at `/assets/`, and catalog/proof pages reference the data globals.

## 2026-05-11 — Step 37.2 App Router refactor

- Leveraged Next.js App Router features on the ported showcase pages.
- Moved ShowcaseHeader + MobilePanel into root `app/layout.tsx` (single render), removed from all 6 page files.
- Added per-page `metadata` exports with unique titles matching the original static HTML `<title>` tags.
- Converted ShowcaseHeader to `"use client"` + `usePathname()`, eliminating the manual `currentPath` prop.
- Switched all imports from `../../src/` to the configured `@/` path alias.
- Added `viewport` export to root layout.
- Added `*.tsbuildinfo` to `.gitignore`.

## 2026-05-11 — Spec drift fix all + dev docs reconciliation

- Ran `/spec-drift fix all` across 14 canonical specs, extracting 284 claims: 186 verified (65%), 33 diverged, 65 unimplemented.
- Archived 5 legacy kanban specs (`kanban-multi-user`, `kanban-offline-queue-soft-delete`, `board-flag-kanban-search`, `kanban-command-test-coverage`, `kanban-production-test-plan`) to `docs/history/archive/2026-05-11/165500/specs/`.
- Updated 7 specs to match code: poketo path/scope/migration fixes, showcase heading/variable corrections, benchmark coverage model alignment, monorepo lane-spec field cleanup, fleet Portfolio lane addition, creator pack rename.
- Kept newsletter capture spec and showcase/benchmark/monorepo unimplemented features as future work.
- Ran `/reconcile-dev-docs` to fix Phase 35 ✓ marker in roadmap overview table, update recurring spec-drift cadence, and annotate manual tasks with Phase 37 migration notes.

## 2026-05-11 — Ship-end clean queue unblock

- Ran `$ship-end --no-deploy` after the roadmap queue flagged a dirty worktree blocker.
- Verified `git status --short --branch` was clean against `origin/master`; no benchmark report or showcase changes remained to commit.
- Updated `tasks/todo.md` to mark the dirty-worktree blocker resolved so Phase 37 planning can proceed next.
- Deploy skipped by request via `--no-deploy`.

## 2026-05-11 — Reconcile dev docs fix

- Fixed roadmap header phase count (34→36 complete), summary paragraph (Phase 36 planned→complete), 7 unchecked acceptance criteria across 2 completed sections, 5 missing ✓ markers (Phases 28, 29, 30, 34, 36), and 2 stale pre-phase planning sections (Codex Custom Coverage, Showcase MVP) now marked superseded.
- Updated `tasks/reconciliation-report.md` with resolved, deferred, and remaining findings.

## 2026-05-11 — Fix hero h1 mobile layout + ship benchmark results

- Fixed hero h1 squished on mobile by removing `ch`-based `max-width` constraints at tablet (≤1080px) and small-mobile (≤560px) breakpoints in `docs/skills-showcase/styles.css`.
- Shipped pre-existing both-agent `ship` benchmark results (`benchmark/test-ship-2026-05-11.md`) with Claude 0/3 and Codex 3/3 pass rates.

## 2026-05-11 — Ship benchmark self-route fix

- Updated mirrored `ship` contracts so completed `$ship`/`/ship` runs do not routinely recommend shipping again as the next route.
- Added layer1 contract lint coverage for the self-route guard and retry exception.
- Re-ran the focused Codex `ship` benchmark after the contract change; it passed 3/3 hard assertions with no infrastructure blocks.

## 2026-05-11 — Benchmark agent review follow-up skill

- Added mirrored `benchmark-agent-review` skills to the `agentic-skills-bench` pack for subjective agent review of persisted benchmark artifacts after `$benchmark-test-skill`.
- Kept the review score separate from hard assertion pass rate and deterministic output-quality score, with median/range reporting for multiple review passes.
- Registered the new skill in benchmark coverage with a custom pack workflow fixture and refreshed Skills Showcase generated assets.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 36 Steps 36.1-36.3: benchmark quality foundation

- Added red layer1 tests and fixtures for benchmark output-quality evaluation, covering weighted rubric aggregation, minimum thresholds, critical failures, evaluator notes, strong/generic/degraded/hallucinated fixture behavior, and reference-trait expectations.
- Added dependency-free benchmark quality primitives and types for weighted rubric scoring, threshold evaluation, critical failures, notes, required facts, forbidden fabrications, required patterns, specificity, and reference traits.
- Persisted optional per-run quality results and added report summaries for average quality score, threshold failures, critical failures, and lowest-scoring criteria while keeping hard assertion pass rate separate.
- Extended benchmark report tests to require an `Output Quality` section that separates quality score summaries from hard assertion pass rate and excludes infrastructure-blocked runs from quality statistics.
- Extended setup registry tests to require opted-in custom setups such as `run` to expose a quality evaluator while preserving compatibility for setups that only define hard assertions, and added the first `run` quality rubric.
- Included the pre-existing benchmark runner budget-exhaustion handling already present in the worktree: agent budget errors are classified as infrastructure-blocked and the `run` workflow uses the standard benchmark budget.
- Verified with an initial red `pnpm --dir tests test:layer1 -- bench-quality bench-report bench-setups`, then passing focused layer1 coverage, benchmark coverage validation, `git diff --check`, a 3-run Claude `run` benchmark after the budget fix, and a 1-run Claude `run` benchmark after quality artifact wiring.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 35 Step 35.4: Tier 1 custom benchmark setups

- Added custom Codex benchmark setups for Tier 1 workflow skills: `run`, `ship`, `ship-end`, `roadmap`, `plan-phase`, `feature-interview`, `spec-interview`, `investigate`, `session-triage`, `targeted-skill-builder`, and `benchmark-test-skill`.
- Registered the new setups in the benchmark harness and updated the coverage matrix to mark those rows as `custom` with Tier 1 fixture metadata.
- Extended layer1 coverage for Tier 1 setup resolution, coverage row metadata, CLI list output, generic fallback retention, and representative assertion paths.
- Verified with targeted `bench-setups.test.ts`, `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage`, full `pnpm --dir tests test:layer1`, `pnpm --dir tests bench --list-skills`, a zero-run custom `run` benchmark smoke, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 35 Step 35.3: reusable benchmark setup helpers

- Added shared layer4 setup helpers for generated artifacts, Markdown/frontmatter assertions, routing handoffs, budget/timeout tiers, and benchmark report expectations.
- Refactored the existing `design-system` and `design-system-draftstonk` custom setups to use those helpers without changing prompts, fixtures, budgets, timeouts, or intended assertion descriptions.
- Added focused layer1 coverage for representative helper behavior and preserved custom setup resolution.
- Verified with targeted `bench-setups.test.ts`, `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage`, full `pnpm --dir tests test:layer1`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-10 — Benchmark harness, birpc fix validation, agentic-skills-bench pack

- Validated birpc fix (execSync → async execFile): layer1 (1177 tests, 8.3s) + layer2 (2 tests, 179s) pass cleanly with no false-failure exit codes.
- Ran 3-run benchmark for design-system skill: 100% pass rate, p50=89s, $1/run, consistency 0.790.
- Created `benchmark/test-design-system-2026-05-10.md` consolidated report.
- Created `docs/test-harness.md` documenting terminology (verify/bench/benchmark-test-skill), layers, and the benchmark-test prompt.
- Created `packs/agentic-skills-bench/` pack with `benchmark-test-skill` skill (claude + codex) for running verify→bench→report.
- Added bench infrastructure: `tests/bench.ts`, `tests/verify.ts`, bench harness modules, layer4 vitest config, design-system-complex test + fixture.

## 2026-05-09 - Slim ship-one-step handoff contract

- Replaced 3 verbose ship-one-step handoff contracts (~350 words each) with slim one-liners: "implement only this step, validate it, then run `/ship` when done."
- Removed 6 constraints from `/ship` SKILL.md that duplicated CLAUDE.md (amend history, commit secrets, feature branches, GitHub Actions, production deploy, code-in-deploy).
- Shortened "Always Ship Mutations" in CLAUDE.md to delegate back to `/ship` instead of inlining ceremony instructions.
- Replaced AGENTS.md "Always Ship Mutations" with Codex-appropriate version (no EnterPlanMode/ExitPlanMode references).
- Updated both templates in provision-agentic-config SKILL.md to match.
- Net token savings: ~1,350 tokens across `/ship`, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md per session.

## 2026-05-08 - Phase 34 Step 34.5: final launch validation and phase close

- Ran final Skills Showcase launch validation across generated data freshness, JavaScript syntax, route file presence, link/CTA scans, accessibility/reduced-motion hooks, manual deploy contract, and whitespace checks.
- Refreshed `docs/skills-showcase/assets/github-proof-data.js` after validation found stale proof history metadata from the latest task updates.
- Confirmed pending manual launch tasks remain explicit: newsletter provider endpoint setup and Vercel deployed-route verification.
- Archived Phase 34 and marked the Skills Showcase Website MVP phase complete in the roadmap.
- Verified with `scripts/validate-skills-showcase-data.sh`, `node --check docs/skills-showcase/app.js`, static route file checks, one local HTTP HEAD for `/`, targeted scans, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-08 - Phase 34 Step 34.4: Vercel static deployment contract

- Added `tasks/deploy.md` as the explicit manual deploy contract for hosting `docs/skills-showcase/` on Vercel as a static site.
- Recorded Vercel settings: project root `docs/skills-showcase/`, no build command, no install command, output directory `.`, no runtime API, no database, and no GitHub Actions.
- Updated manual launch tasks for newsletter provider endpoint setup and Vercel route verification with after-step timing.
- Verified with targeted deploy/manual-task/no-GitHub-Actions scans and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-08 - Phase 34 Step 34.3: launch proof/follow telemetry boundaries

- Added inspect-route proof-to-follow CTAs, generated static telemetry summary copy, and an explicit static-proof limitation note.
- Strengthened follow proof-funnel copy around route freshness, GitHub fallback status, newsletter-performance boundaries, and non-claims for live LexCorp metrics.
- Rendered generated proof summary counts, GitHub enrichment fallback cards, and extra boundary rows from committed proof data.
- Refreshed Skills Showcase generated assets after freshness validation found stale fingerprints/history/skill metadata.
- Verified with `scripts/validate-skills-showcase-data.sh`, `node --check docs/skills-showcase/app.js`, targeted proof/boundary scans, local HTTP HEAD checks for `/inspect/` and `/follow/`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-08 - Phase 34 Step 34.2: newsletter static provider contract

- Replaced the provider-pending newsletter preview with a static/provider-backed form contract on `/follow/`.
- Added provider-missing, invalid-email, pending, success, and error states with accessible live status copy and scoped status styling.
- Kept the committed default non-collecting by leaving `data-provider-endpoint` empty; configured-provider submission is isolated to a static provider `fetch` path with no runtime API, database, dependency, or GitHub Actions workflow.
- Verified with `node --check docs/skills-showcase/app.js`, targeted state and no-backend scans, local HTTP HEAD route validation for `/follow/`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-08 - Phase 34 Step 34.1: follow/about conversion route

- Replaced the follow placeholder with a launch-oriented static route for G, LexCorp, YouTube, X/Twitter, Discord, GitHub, inspect, catalog, and newsletter-preview actions.
- Added scoped follow route CSS for conversion cards, proof stats, generated receipt previews, newsletter provider-pending preview, and mobile grid collapse.
- Added a follow proof renderer that consumes generated static GitHub/proof data without claiming live LexCorp product metrics or collecting visitor analytics.
- Verified with `scripts/validate-skills-showcase-data.sh`, `node --check docs/skills-showcase/app.js`, targeted CTA/proof/fallback scans, local HTTP route fetches for `/follow/`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-08 - Phase 33 Step 33.4: final validation and phase transition

- Ran final Phase 33 validation across generated skill/proof data, app syntax, static route reloads, generated asset serving, targeted route/content scans, desktop browser checks, and mobile-width browser checks.
- Confirmed generated catalog search/filter/count/expand behavior, workflow lab controls for all eight curated workflows, pack map project-type/overlay/alias behavior, inspect proof receipts, homepage workflow previews, and mobile navigation.
- Marked Phase 33 acceptance criteria complete, archived the phase to `tasks/phases/phase-33.md`, and prepared Phase 34 with serial launch/distribution steps.
- Added manual launch tasks for the static newsletter provider endpoint and Vercel static deployment verification.
- Verified with `scripts/validate-skills-showcase-data.sh`, `node --check docs/skills-showcase/app.js`, targeted `rg` scans, local static `curl -sS` checks, Brave desktop/mobile-width checks, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-08 - Phase 33 Step 33.3: pack map and responsive route behavior

- Added project-type highlighter controls, overlay visibility, generated pack annotations, alias/overlay labels, keyboard-selectable pack nodes, and a live pack detail panel to `/packs/`.
- Added global-core and output bands so the pack map distinguishes shared foundations, domain packs, overlays, compatibility aliases, and generated artifact outcomes.
- Tightened responsive constraints for route headings, generated card layouts, controls, detail panels, catalog rows, and compact mobile surfaces.
- Verified with `node --check docs/skills-showcase/app.js`, `scripts/validate-skills-showcase-data.sh`, targeted route/content scans, local static `curl` checks, Brave desktop route inspection, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-08 - Phase 33 Step 33.2: workflow lab content and browser-native animations

- Added the full eight-workflow curated set to the Skills Showcase: first successful cycle, pack selection, plan -> run -> ship, spec -> roadmap -> implementation, research chains, hybrid handoff, skill authoring, and validation/troubleshooting.
- Rebuilt `/workflows/` as a data-driven static lab with command-first selector cards, manual previous/next/play/restart controls, progress rails, stage animation, artifact/change lists, and failure/recovery text.
- Added the homepage workflow preview band and wired the homepage skill-count metric to generated `skills-data.js`.
- Verified with `node --check docs/skills-showcase/app.js`, `scripts/validate-skills-showcase-data.sh`, targeted route/content scans, local static `curl` checks, Brave desktop route inspection, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-08 - Phase 33 Step 33.1: generated catalog and proof route wiring

- Wired the Skills Showcase catalog, packs, and inspect routes to committed generated browser globals instead of placeholder rows.
- Catalog now renders generated skill rows with search, platform/type/scope filters, visible/total counts, one-platform labels, and expandable GitHub source links.
- Packs now renders generated pack metrics, platform coverage, skill counts, PACK.md links, and compatibility-alias fallback language.
- Inspect now renders generated repository evidence, public GitHub fallback status, proof artifacts, validation scripts, recent history entries, and boundary language.
- Verified with `node --check docs/skills-showcase/app.js`, `scripts/validate-skills-showcase-data.sh`, targeted generated-data/placeholder scans, local static route/asset `curl` checks, diff-aware self-review, and `git diff --check`.
- Recorded residual visual-verification risk: Playwright is unavailable and macOS Computer Use permissions are not granted, so full desktop/mobile screenshot validation remains part of Step 33.4.

## 2026-05-07 - Phase 32 Step 32.6: validation and phase transition

- Ran the full Phase 32 validation gate: showcase generators, static app syntax, validator syntax, freshness validation, route file presence, generated-data scans, skill dependency/version/routing audits, pack-routing audit, layer1 Vitest suite, and `git diff --check`.
- Confirmed all Phase 32 acceptance criteria are satisfied without adding a database, runtime API, GitHub Actions workflow, video/Remotion implementation, visitor analytics, live LexCorp metrics, secrets, or unnecessary root dependencies.
- Archived the completed phase to `tasks/phases/phase-32.md`, marked Phase 32 complete in `tasks/roadmap.md`, and prepared Phase 33 as the active todo with generated catalog/proof wiring as Step 33.1.

## 2026-05-07 - Phase 32 Step 32.5: skill mutation showcase freshness contracts

- Updated mirrored `create-agentic-skill`, `targeted-skill-builder`, `run`, and `ship` contracts so tracked `SKILL.md` or `PACK.md` behavior/metadata changes refresh Skills Showcase data before shipping.
- Added maintainer-facing Skills Showcase freshness guidance to `docs/skills-reference.md`, including generator commands, freshness validation, generated asset shipping, and curated website/proof review.
- Regenerated `docs/skills-showcase/assets/skills-data.js` and `docs/skills-showcase/assets/github-proof-data.js` for the changed skill-contract fingerprints.
- Verified with showcase generators, stale/fresh validator behavior, install, skill dependency/version/routing audits, pack-routing audit, targeted command-presence scans, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-07 - Phase 32 Step 32.4: skills showcase stale-data validation

- Added `scripts/validate-skills-showcase-data.sh` as the canonical freshness gate for committed Skills Showcase generated assets.
- The validator reruns both showcase generators, compares generated asset fingerprints before and after generation, and fails with explicit remediation commands when the current working-copy assets are stale.
- Updated the catalog and proof generators to avoid commit-derived freshness fields that would make generated assets stale immediately after a shipping commit.
- Regenerated `docs/skills-showcase/assets/skills-data.js` and `docs/skills-showcase/assets/github-proof-data.js`; the proof data now lists the showcase freshness validator among validation receipts.
- Verified with Bash syntax check, Node syntax checks for both generators, stale/fresh validator runs, targeted validator content scans, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-07 - Phase 32 Step 32.3: skills showcase proof data

- Added `scripts/generate-skills-showcase-github-data.mjs`, a dependency-free proof generator for the static showcase Inspect surface.
- Generated committed `docs/skills-showcase/assets/github-proof-data.js` with local repository URL, branch, HEAD commit evidence, tracked proof artifacts, validation script references, recent history headings, explicit boundary language, and public GitHub metadata status.
- Kept public GitHub metadata optional: restricted network or unauthenticated failures produce an honest fallback instead of failing the generator or inventing metrics.
- Verified with generator execution, Node syntax check, targeted browser-global/data-shape checks, targeted proof scans, generated-output idempotence check, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-07 - Phase 32 Step 32.2: skills showcase catalog data

- Added `scripts/generate-skills-showcase-data.mjs`, a dependency-free generator that scans tracked `global/*/*/SKILL.md`, `packs/*/{claude,codex}/*/SKILL.md`, and `packs/*/PACK.md` sources.
- Generated committed `docs/skills-showcase/assets/skills-data.js` with `312` skills, `16` packs, `327` source inputs, derived commands, path metadata, pack summaries, tags, and a deterministic source fingerprint.
- Made generation stable for unchanged sources by deriving `generatedAt` from the latest Git commit timestamp for the tracked source inputs rather than wall-clock time.
- Verified with generator execution, Node syntax check, targeted browser-global/data-shape checks, generated-output idempotence check, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-07 — Fold consistently-accepted patterns into ux-variation and ui-interview

- Updated `ux-variation/SKILL.md` to default to 5 maximally contrasting variants, skip breadth/count/evaluator questions, remove pre-build narrowing options (Remove one, Merge concepts), require full buildout of all variants before evaluation, add "Make this a variant axis" affordance for ambiguous design decisions, and unlock per-variation design constraints (only tech stack shared).
- Updated `ui-interview/SKILL.md` to make accessibility mandatory by default (not optional checkboxes), treat product specs/ICPs/journey maps as overridable reference material, and deprioritize reference/inspiration questions.
- No changes needed to `ui-consolidate/SKILL.md` — its design already aligns with these patterns.
- Verified with `./install.sh`, `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `./scripts/skill-next-step-routing.sh --missing`, targeted `rg` scans for old/new patterns, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-07 — Parallel agent branch/PR guard

- Added the narrow `agent-team` branch exception to root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` guidance and to the `provision-agentic-config` templates that regenerate those blocks.
- Updated mirrored `roadmap`, `plan-phase`, `run`, `mono-plan`, `mono-guard`, `mono-run`, `mono-ship`, `branch-lifecycle`, and `patch-exec-profile` contracts so parallel write lanes use separate non-primary GitHub branches and return branch, commit SHA, validation, and PR evidence.
- Added consolidation/PR review as a required planning and integration gate before final validation or shipping for `agent-team` work.
- Extended `lane-spec-validate.sh` and monorepo fixtures so package lane specs require unique non-primary branch names.
- Recorded the correction in `tasks/lessons.md` and updated monorepo docs/reference material.
- Verified with `./install.sh`, skill dependency/version/routing audits, pack-routing audit, lane-spec valid/invalid checks, `monorepo-validate.sh`, targeted policy scans, `pnpm --dir tests test`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-06 — Feature interview evidence intake

- Enhanced mirrored Claude/Codex `feature-interview` contracts so impromptu feature ideas start with an evidence-backed intake pass before deep interrogation.
- Required claim validation against code, docs, research, task state, and git history where relevant, while preserving `investigate` as the route for actual bug fixing.
- Added technical gotcha discovery across architecture, data model, APIs/contracts, migrations, security/privacy, performance, observability, tests, rollout, and external dependencies.
- Required user-story, journey, workflow, or loop placement and explicit documentation destination decisions for specs, research, journey docs, roadmap, task queues, interview logs, or no action.
- Added a user-confirmed priority gate before roadmap or task mutation and updated the durable interview-log output contract.
- Refreshed Codex metadata and skill discovery descriptions.
- Verified with stale-text scans, skill dependency/version/routing audits, pack-routing audit, layer1 tests, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-06 — Live skill behavior harness

- Added opt-in layer3 Vitest live-agent tests that invoke Claude with `claude -p` and Codex with `codex exec` in temporary git repositories.
- Added reusable live harness helpers for temp fixtures, structured JSON schema output, CLI invocation, command availability checks, and cleanup.
- Added session-analysis behavior scenarios that verify `session-triage` handles one concrete incident and `analyze-sessions` handles broad repeated-prompt trends.
- Added package scripts for skipped layer3 dry runs, all live tests, Claude-only live tests, and Codex-only live tests.
- Documented live harness usage and budget/CLI requirements in `README.md`.
- Verified with skipped layer3 dry run, live Claude and Codex runs, layer1 tests, skill contract scripts, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-05 — Session triage split

- Split focused one-session/one-issue investigations out of `analyze-sessions` into mirrored Claude/Codex `session-triage` skills.
- Restored `analyze-sessions` to broad cross-session trends, repeated prompt patterns, workflow evolution, automation opportunities, and skill performance over time.
- Added Codex `session-triage` agent metadata and narrowed `analyze-sessions` metadata to broad history analysis.
- Updated discovery docs, skill grouping, operating-mode roles, next-step contracts, and `targeted-skill-builder` routing guidance.
- Recorded the naming lesson: avoid near-identical singular/plural command pairs for split workflows.
- Verified with install, skill dependency/version/routing audits, layer1 tests, targeted scans, exact no-`analyze-session` directory check, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-05 — Analyze-sessions targeted skill retrospectives

- Updated mirrored Claude/Codex `analyze-sessions` contracts so the skill can audit a named skill's performance in a repo or session after a user identifies a possible mistake.
- Added targeted evidence scoping across `agentic-skills`, pack/project-local skill directories, installed read-only fallback copies, and Claude/Codex session metadata.
- Required reports to distinguish user-identified mistakes from agent-verified mistakes before recommending fixes.
- Added output requirements for root cause, exact skill-contract changes, validation plans, confidence, evidence gaps, and next-skill routing.
- Verified with install, targeted mirrored scans, skill dependency/version/routing audits, layer1 tests, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-05 — Agentic config Claude/Codex split

- Updated root `AGENTS.md` to keep Codex subagent guidance constrained by active Codex tool permissions while leaving Claude-specific subagent defaults in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Split mirrored provisioning contracts so `provision-agentic-config` writes a Claude block to `CLAUDE.md` and an AGENTS block to `AGENTS.md`.
- Tightened bootstrap verification language to check the corresponding workflow block in each target file.
- Recorded the config-generation lesson so future audits do not assume mirrored agent config is harmless.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 14 Step 14.3: LinkedIn lane docs

- Documented the LinkedIn-first lane in `packs/creator-foundation/PACK.md`, `packs/creator-media/PACK.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/skills-reference.md`.
- Routed LinkedIn evidence through `creator-platform-capability-matrix -> creator-evidence-schema -> creator-presence-dossier` rather than a standalone scraper.
- Stated the baseline as owner exports, manual snapshots, public unauthenticated captures, and user-provided files.
- Kept paid APIs, logged-in scraping, bot-protection bypass, private-data collection, private relationship graph extraction, paywall access, and access-control circumvention out of scope.
- Verified with targeted docs scans, skill dependency/version/routing audits, layer1 tests, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 14 Step 14.2: LinkedIn dossier evidence handling

- Hardened mirrored `creator-presence-dossier` contracts so LinkedIn evidence must come from owner-provided exports, user-provided snapshots, public unauthenticated captures, or authorized owner/admin material.
- Required LinkedIn evidence-register classification as public, owner-provided, admin-provided, internal notes, or mixed/redaction needed.
- Required private or mixed LinkedIn material to be redacted or excluded before synthesis and forbade summarizing private contacts, private messages, relationship data, sensitive account data, unrelated personal information, or confidential employer/customer material into the public dossier.
- Verified with mirrored contract diff, targeted LinkedIn safety scans, skill dependency/version/routing audits, layer1 tests, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-04 — Pack workflow matrix documentation

- Added `docs/pack-workflow-matrix.md` as the current source for pack workflow ordering, lead-in recommendations, overlay dependencies, and compatibility aliases.
- Linked the matrix from `README.md`, `docs/packs.md`, and `docs/skills-reference.md`.
- Updated pack guidance so `monorepo`, `code-quality`, and `*-kanban` are treated as overlays that usually pair with a domain pack.
- Added missing `alignment-loop`, `remotion`, `monorepo`, and `creator-media` alias coverage to the pack role table in `docs/operating-modes.md`.
- Verified with skill dependency/version/routing audits, `scripts/pack.sh list`, layer1 tests, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-04 — Pack context reorganization

- Split `business-app` into `business-discovery`, `business-growth`, and `business-ops` packs while preserving `business-app` as a compatibility alias.
- Split `creator-media` into `creator-foundation` and `youtube-ops`, moved `youtube-audit` into `youtube-ops`, and preserved `creator-media` as a compatibility alias.
- Moved fleet/portfolio workflows into the new `project-fleet` pack.
- Updated `scripts/pack.sh`, pack metadata, README, pack docs, operating-mode docs, skill references, and global pack/concept guidance for the narrower pack names.
- Preserved the in-progress LinkedIn foundation edits under the moved `creator-foundation` files.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 14 Step 14.1: LinkedIn foundation baseline

- Hardened mirrored creator-media `creator-platform-capability-matrix` and `creator-evidence-schema` contracts for LinkedIn-first evidence collection.
- Made owner exports, manual snapshots, public unauthenticated page captures, and redacted user-provided files the default LinkedIn baseline.
- Marked LinkedIn analytics/API fields as unavailable unless owner-provided, admin-provided, or already authorized, and forbade logged-in scraping, paid API dependency, bot-protection bypass, access-control circumvention, and private-data collection as baseline paths.
- Required redaction or exclusion for private contacts, private messages, relationship data, sensitive account data, unrelated personal information, and confidential employer/customer material before analysis.
- Verified with targeted LinkedIn safety scans, mirrored contract diffs, skill dependency/version/routing audits, layer1 tests, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 26 Step 26.11: focused monorepo pack validation

- Ran the final monorepo pack validation sequence against committed fixtures.
- Verified `monorepo-validate.sh`, lane-spec valid/invalid fixtures, direct `mono-detect.sh` fixture outputs, targeted monorepo skill contract scans, layer1 tests, skill dependency/version/routing audits, `git diff --check`, and the ship quality gate.
- Confirmed pnpm+Turbo detection reports three packages, internal dependency graph edges, and Turbo pipelines, while pnpm-only and not-monorepo fixtures produce the expected outcomes.
- Marked Phase 26 acceptance criteria complete and archived the completed active phase for transition.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 26 Step 26.10: monorepo pack fixtures

- Added committed `tests/fixtures/monorepo` inputs for pnpm+Turbo, pnpm-only, and not-monorepo detection cases.
- Added valid and invalid lane-spec JSON fixtures covering disjoint ownership, required root `must_not_edit` boundaries, valid dependencies, and overlapping `owns` rejection.
- Verified the fixtures through `monorepo-validate.sh`, direct lane-spec validator positive/negative checks, skill dependency/version/routing audits, `pnpm --dir tests test`, and `git diff --check`.
- Preserved the unrelated in-progress Remotion pack split edits outside the Step 26.10 shipping boundary.
- Recorded the Step 26.10 quality-gate manifest in `tasks/todo.md`.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 26 Step 26.9: monorepo pack validation script

- Added `packs/monorepo/scripts/monorepo-validate.sh` to verify augmentation injection sections, mirrored Claude/Codex skill structure, Codex `agents/openai.yaml` manifests, lane-spec fixtures, and monorepo detection fixtures.
- Normalized `mono-detect` and `mono-guard` Claude/Codex contracts with explicit `## Augmentation Injection Pattern` sections so pack validation can enforce the contract consistently.
- Kept fixture-backed validation required by default while adding `--skip-fixtures` for Step 26.9 pre-fixture checks; committed fixtures are still planned for Step 26.10 and full fixture execution for Step 26.11.
- Verified with `bash -n`, `monorepo-validate.sh --skip-fixtures`, skill dependency/version/routing audits, `pnpm --dir tests test`, `git diff --check`, and the ship quality gate.
- Recorded the Step 26.9 quality-gate manifest in `tasks/todo.md`.

## 2026-05-04 — Split local and repo-managed skill creation

- Renamed the user-local skill authoring workflow from `create-skill` to `create-local-skill` in both `global/claude` and `global/codex`.
- Added mirrored `create-agentic-skill` workflows for creating or updating repo-managed skills under `global/claude/<name>/` and `global/codex/<name>/`, including validation, targeted staging, commit, and push guidance.
- Updated `tasks/lessons.md` so future corrections distinguish local skill creation from agentic-skills repository contributions.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 26 Step 26.8: monorepo pack docs and discovery

- Registered the `monorepo` pack in `README.md`, `docs/skills-reference.md`, and `docs/packs.md`.
- Added install/discovery references, skill inventory, and default flow for `mono-detect`, `mono-run`, `mono-guard`, and `mono-ship`.
- Documented the augmentation injection pattern and how it differs from `*-kanban` workflow variants.
- Documented lane-spec artifacts, lifecycle states, and package-scope YAML frontmatter tags for specs and roadmap phases.
- Verified the docs with targeted scans, skill dependency/version/routing audits, `pnpm --dir tests test`, and `git diff --check`.
- Recorded the Step 26.8 quality-gate manifest in `tasks/todo.md`.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 26 Step 26.7: mono-ship skill contracts

- Added mirrored Claude/Codex `mono-ship` skill contracts and Codex OpenAI metadata for the monorepo pack.
- Documented the pre-ship augmentation flow: `mono-detect`, `.agents/lane-specs.json`, `.agents/monorepo.json`, modified package detection, package-scoped test/lint/build, and transitive-dependent validation from `dependency_graph`.
- Documented Turbo-first validation, `pnpm --filter` fallback behavior, validation-failure stop semantics, standard ship delegation, post-ship lane-spec mirror status updates, and next-step routing.
- Fixed an output-path conflict found by the test harness by keeping `mono-ship`'s post-ship status behavior while avoiding independent ownership of the `mono-run` lane-spec output path.
- Verified the contracts with targeted scans, Claude/Codex parity diff, skill dependency/version/routing audits, `pnpm --dir tests test`, and `git diff --check`.
- Recorded the Step 26.7 quality-gate manifest in `tasks/todo.md`.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 26 Step 26.6: mono-run skill contracts

- Added mirrored Claude/Codex `mono-run` skill contracts and Codex OpenAI metadata for the monorepo pack.
- Documented the augmentation injection flow: `mono-detect`, lane-spec generation, `mono-guard` pre-flight, plan-mode approval, cross-cutting serial work, package-scoped worktree dispatch, post-integration guard checks, and optional `mono-ship` pipeline continuation.
- Documented stop-all-lanes failure semantics, lifecycle updates, `--phase`, `--pipeline`, Turbo validation preference, and `pnpm --filter` fallback behavior.
- Verified the contracts with targeted scans, Claude/Codex parity diff, skill dependency/version/routing audits, `pnpm --dir tests test`, and `git diff --check`.
- Recorded the Step 26.6 quality-gate manifest in `tasks/todo.md`.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 26 Step 26.5: mono-guard skill contracts

- Added mirrored Claude/Codex `mono-guard` skill contracts and Codex OpenAI metadata for the monorepo pack.
- Documented pre-flight validation against `.agents/lane-specs.json`, `lane-spec-validate.sh`, `.agents/monorepo.json`, lane ownership, shared file exclusions, dependency ordering, and lane DAG safety.
- Documented post-integration boundary audits using `git diff --name-only`, lockfile/root-config checks, and out-of-boundary write reporting while preserving compatibility with the global `mono-guard` contract.
- Verified the contracts with targeted scans, Claude/Codex parity diff, skill dependency/version/routing audits, `pnpm --dir tests test`, and `git diff --check`.
- Recorded the Step 26.5 quality-gate manifest in `tasks/todo.md`.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 26 Step 26.4: mono-detect skill contracts

- Added mirrored Claude/Codex `mono-detect` skill contracts and Codex OpenAI metadata for the monorepo pack.
- Documented `mono-detect.sh` execution, `.agents/monorepo.json` staleness behavior, non-monorepo advisory routing, workspace/package/dependency/Turbo summaries, and augmentation foundation usage by `mono-run`, `mono-ship`, and `mono-guard`.
- Verified the contracts with targeted scans, Claude/Codex parity diff, skill dependency/version/routing audits, `pnpm --dir tests test`, and `git diff --check`.
- Recorded the Step 26.4 quality-gate manifest in `tasks/todo.md`.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 26 Step 26.3: lane-spec validation script

- Added `packs/monorepo/scripts/lane-spec-validate.sh` to validate lane-spec required fields, lifecycle state, disjoint `owns` boundaries, required root `must_not_edit` entries, dependency references, and duplicate step IDs.
- Verified the script with temporary valid, overlapping-owns, missing-root-boundary, unknown-dependency, invalid-lifecycle, and duplicate-step fixtures plus `bash -n`, `pnpm --dir tests test`, and `git diff --check`.
- Recorded the Step 26.3 quality-gate manifest in `tasks/todo.md`.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 26 Step 26.2: monorepo detection script

- Added `packs/monorepo/scripts/mono-detect.sh` for pnpm workspace detection, package enumeration, internal dependency graph generation, DAG validation, Turbo pipeline detection, `.agents/monorepo.json` output, and `--check-stale`.
- Verified the script with temporary positive, stale, circular-dependency, and not-monorepo fixtures plus `bash -n`, `pnpm --dir tests test`, and `git diff --check`.
- Recorded the Step 26.2 quality-gate manifest in `tasks/todo.md`.

## 2026-05-04 — Refresh spec drift after monorepo controller spec

- Ran `$spec-drift fix all` after `e350448 spec: monorepo execution controller integration`.
- Archived the previous drift report at `docs/history/archive/2026-05-04/110835/specs/drift-report.md`.
- Refreshed `specs/drift-report.md` with the current spec inventory, including `specs/monorepo-execution-controller.md` and `specs/creator-platform-evidence-schema.md`.
- Found 0 Errors, 1 Warning, and 0 Info findings.
- Queued the Warning in `tasks/todo.md`: `specs/monorepo-execution-controller.md` promises an unimplemented `packs/monorepo` V1 pack, scripts, and fixtures; next work should either implement the pack or rescope the spec.

## 2026-05-04 — Reconcile task docs after Phase 25

- Ran `$reconcile-dev-docs fix tasks` after the Phase 25 codebase-status shipment.
- Checked the shipped Phase 25 commit/push todo item based on clean `git status --short` and `159b4ee feat(skills): add codebase status skill`.
- Corrected `tasks/roadmap.md` completion counts and summary language to reflect 24 complete phases and 1 planned future phase.
- Checked the duplicated Phase 21 milestone checklist that remained stale after `412a5f8 docs(tasks): close quality gate phase`.
- Recorded recent shipped work missing from history: `159b4ee feat(skills): add codebase status skill` and `e350448 spec: monorepo execution controller integration`.

## 2026-05-04 — Add monorepo execution controller spec

- Added `specs/monorepo-execution-controller.md` and `specs/monorepo-execution-controller-interview.md`.
- Captured the pnpm/Turborepo-first monorepo execution controller contract, including package-boundary planning, lane safety, dependency-change discipline, and composition with `$project-fleet`.
- Shipped as `e350448 spec: monorepo execution controller integration`.

## 2026-05-04 — Add codebase status skill

- Added mirrored Claude/Codex `codebase-status` skills plus Codex OpenAI metadata.
- Updated README, `docs/operating-modes.md`, `docs/skills-reference.md`, global skill discovery, `tasks/roadmap.md`, and `tasks/todo.md`.
- Shipped as `159b4ee feat(skills): add codebase status skill`.

## 2026-05-04 — Add headless video-script/video-build test harness

- Extended test harness with creator-media skill testing for `video-script` and `video-build`.
- New `tests/harness/interview.ts`: prompt builder that embeds pre-scripted interview answers for non-interactive runs.
- Extended `tests/harness/fixtures.ts` with `setupDriftctlFixture()` (tier-based artifact selection) and `driftctlScriptFixture()`.
- Extended `tests/harness/judge.ts` with `hasSourceAttribution()`, `hasUngroundedSection()`, and `matchesNarrativeArc()` assertions.
- Added Driftctl fixtures: creator-positioning, product-led-media-map, journey-map, gtm, video-script golden, and series-spec.
- 4 video-script tests (launch-tier4, explainer-tier2, demo-tier1, launch-tier3-series), 2 video-build tests (minimal, kinetic-text), 1 pipeline test (script→build chain).
- Budget: $1.50/test, 5-min timeout. Total: 7 tests, ~$10.50 max for full suite.

## 2026-05-04 — Add skill pack test harness

- Built two-layer test architecture in `tests/`: layer1 (structural, free, instant) and layer2 (LLM-in-the-loop via `claude --print`).
- Layer1: 1147 tests across 4 suites — frontmatter validation (all SKILL.md files), routing graph integrity, pack.sh install correctness, and output path conflict detection.
- Layer2: destination-doc, vertical-slice-splitter, and full pipeline e2e tests with $0.50 budget caps per claude invocation.
- Harness utilities: runner.ts (temp project + claude execution), judge.ts (structural validators), fixtures.ts (fixture loader), types.ts.
- Fixtures: app-idea-fitness-tracker.md, destination-doc-sample.md, golden schemas for destination doc and issue card structure.
- Default `pnpm test` runs only layer1 (free); `pnpm test:layer2` is opt-in.

## 2026-05-03 — Harden correction enforcement in quality gate

- Tightened `docs/quality-gate-contract.md` so user corrections are presumed repeatable until the ship manifest proves otherwise.
- Updated `$run`, `$ship`, `$ship-end`, and `$commit-and-push-by-feature` so correction follow-ups require current-shipping-boundary `tasks/lessons.md` evidence plus an enforcement update or a pre-commit `Correction enforcement:` rationale.
- Applied review-lane findings that removed weak `when practical` and final-response escape hatches and required exact file/rule/check citations for existing-rule coverage.
- Validation passed: targeted correction-enforcement `rg` scan and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-03 — Add YouTube description optimizer

- Added mirrored Claude/Codex `youtube-description-optimizer` skills to the creator-media pack for existing-video description audits, future upload drafts, and reusable description templates.
- Wired the skill into creator-media docs and next-skill routing between `youtube-title-thumbnail-audit` and `youtube-portfolio`, while preserving the in-progress `video-script` / `video-build` flow.
- Validation passed: targeted contract/docs/routing scans, normalized Claude/Codex skill diff, `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash ./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash ./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `./scripts/skill-next-step-routing.sh --missing`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-03 — Mutation-capable next-step routing audit

- Added `scripts/skill-next-step-routing.sh` to audit mutation-capable skill contracts for missing final next-step routing.
- Patched mutation-capable skill contracts: default shipping-contract skills now require either `Recommended next skill` or the `Next work` / `Recommended next command` handoff, and kanban mutation wrappers now include a `## Next-Step Routing` section.
- Recorded Phase 16 in `tasks/roadmap.md` and `tasks/todo.md`. Validation passed: `./scripts/skill-next-step-routing.sh --missing`, `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, targeted routing counts, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-02 — Wire creator-media evidence foundation into docs

- Registered `creator-platform-capability-matrix` and `creator-evidence-schema` ahead of platform-specific audits in `packs/creator-media/PACK.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/skills-reference.md`.
- Clarified that YouTube-specific work may still start at `youtube-channel-audit`, while non-YouTube or mixed-platform creator-media work starts with the platform capability matrix and evidence schema.
- Validation passed: targeted creator-media routing scans, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-02 — ICP skill final-response next-step echo

- Added instruction to both Claude and Codex ICP skills requiring the agent to repeat the Recommended next step from the generated `## Next Steps` section in the final chat response.
- Files changed: `packs/business-app/claude/icp/SKILL.md`, `packs/business-app/codex/icp/SKILL.md`.

## 2026-05-02 — Add pack next-step routing contracts

- Added explicit `## Next-Skill Routing` sections to all mirrored creator-media, game, and code-quality pack skills.
- Creator-media skills now recommend the next contextual skill across the documented flow: channel audit, title/thumbnail audit, portfolio, peer benchmark, search positioning, cadence diagnosis, creator positioning, content programming, series spec, product-led media map, and metrics review.
- Game skills now recommend the next game-pack skill across audience, fantasy, genre, comparables, core loop, prototype test, playtest metrics, store-page test, launch, and roadmap, with upstream rerouting when evidence invalidates an earlier assumption.
- Code-quality skills now recommend `extract-shared-types`, `quality-sweep fix`, `regression-check`, or `ship` based on audit vs mutation state.
- Filled business-app recommendation gaps in `investor-update` and Claude `reconcile-research`, and tightened `risk-register`, `metrics`, and `experiment` so they emit explicit recommended next steps instead of ambiguous "Pick one" outputs.
- Validation passed: routing coverage scans for creator-media/game/code-quality, targeted business-app ambiguity scan, `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash ./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash ./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-02 — Creator platform evidence schema spec

- Ran `$spec-interview` for expanding the creator-media pack beyond YouTube.
- Chose a matrix-first implementation target: `creator-platform-capability-matrix`, `creator-evidence-schema`, and `creator-presence-dossier` before platform-specific audit skills.
- Constrained the baseline collection model to free, open-source, and manual evidence paths: owner exports, manual snapshots, RSS/feed capture, public page capture, and optional OSS tools.
- Made LinkedIn the first non-YouTube priority lane, using owner exports and manual/public snapshots rather than paid API access or logged-in scraping.
- Added `specs/creator-platform-evidence-schema.md` and `specs/creator-platform-evidence-schema-interview.md`.

## 2026-05-01 — YouTube audit transcript dependency self-healing

- Fixed the mirrored global `youtube-audit` skills so missing `youtube-transcript-api` is handled through a project-local `.venv`.
- Claude and Codex variants now create `.venv` when needed, install with `.venv/bin/python -m pip install youtube-transcript-api`, rerun the import check, and use that interpreter for transcript fetching.
- Preserved the explicit guard against Homebrew/system Python installs and `--break-system-packages`.
- Added `.venv/` to `.gitignore` and recorded the correction pattern in `tasks/lessons.md`.

## 2026-05-01 — Add creator-media YouTube diagnostics

- Added mirrored Claude/Codex creator-media skills for `youtube-title-thumbnail-audit`, `youtube-search-positioning`, and `youtube-cadence-diagnosis`.
- `youtube-title-thumbnail-audit` scores title patterns and thumbnail visual signals against channel performance and peer packaging evidence, then writes `research/youtube/title-thumbnail-audit-<slug>.md`.
- `youtube-search-positioning` maps query demand, ranking competition, and underserved YouTube search opportunities, then writes `research/youtube/search-positioning-<slug>.md`.
- `youtube-cadence-diagnosis` computes upload streaks, gaps, post-gap performance patterns, and realistic cadence recommendations, then writes `research/youtube/cadence-diagnosis-<slug>.md`.
- Updated creator-media pack docs in `packs/creator-media/PACK.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/skills-reference.md` so the new skills are discoverable in the pack flow.

## 2026-05-01 — Spec drift fix all

- Ran `$spec-drift fix all` against the current flat `specs/` inventory after `3e3bbf6` updated the `$youtube-audit` transcript dependency guidance.
- Added `specs/project-fleet.md` as the canonical spec for `$project-fleet`, resolving the prior Info-class coverage gap for a public fleet orchestration workflow.
- Archived the previous drift report at `docs/history/archive/2026-05-01/112050/specs/drift-report.md` before replacing `specs/drift-report.md`.
- Refreshed `specs/drift-report.md` with current evidence for approval packets, code-quality pack layout, project-fleet, headless kanban migration, legacy kanban fallback specs, devtool research artifacts, and the youtube local-venv change.
- Result: 0 Errors, 0 Warnings, 0 Info findings remain in the current audit scope.

## 2026-05-01 — Research roadmap finds post-drift source change

- Ran `$research-roadmap` after the post-audit refresh and re-scanned the devtool documentation queue.
- Confirmed the devtool research chain is complete and no missing devtool research artifact remains.
- Found one strict freshness trigger: source commit `3e3bbf6` (`fix(skills): use local venv for youtube transcripts`, 2026-05-01 10:19:30 -0400) is newer than `specs/drift-report.md` (2026-04-30 14:02:55 -0400).
- Promoted `$spec-drift fix all` into `tasks/todo.md` as the next priority documentation item.

## 2026-05-01 — Post-audit research roadmap refresh

- Re-ran the `$research-roadmap` decision path after `research/devtool-docs-audit.md` completed the devtool default-flow research chain.
- Confirmed the current devtool documentation set is complete: user map, integration map, DX journey, adoption, positioning, monetization, and docs audit all exist.
- Confirmed the 2026-04-30 creator-media pack work is already shipped and recorded, and no additional priority documentation item needs promotion into `tasks/todo.md`.
- Marked the post-audit refresh acceptance criteria complete in `tasks/todo.md`; the Priority Documentation Todo queue is now explicitly empty.

## 2026-04-30 — Devtool docs audit research

- Created `research/devtool-docs-audit.md` as the final default-flow devtool research artifact for `agentic-skills`.
- Audited `README.md`, `docs/skills-reference.md`, `docs/packs.md`, `docs/operating-modes.md`, and the completed devtool research chain for quickstart clarity, examples, API/script reference, troubleshooting, migration paths, and proof artifacts.
- Found no P0 documentation blocker for a shell-comfortable user. Logged the highest-leverage improvements as README first-success quickstart, curated dogfood examples, central troubleshooting, compact script reference, team rollout checklist, and better surfacing of proof artifacts.
- Checked off `$devtool-docs-audit` in `tasks/todo.md`; the active Priority Documentation Todo queue is now complete, and the next planned step is a post-audit `$research-roadmap` refresh.

## 2026-04-30 — Devtool positioning research

- Created `research/devtool-positioning.md` for the `agentic-skills` devtool research chain.
- Positioned the repo against raw Claude/Codex usage, personal dotfiles, vendor-native instructions, prompt libraries, task runners, hosted agent platforms, and internal prompt frameworks.
- Captured workflow advantages, ecosystem fit, evidence-backed trust claims, switching costs, concise positioning, homepage-style copy, differentiated claims, taglines, and avoided positioning.
- Checked off `$devtool-positioning` in `tasks/todo.md`; `$devtool-monetization` is now unblocked.

## 2026-04-30 — Add creator-media YouTube strategy pack

- Upgraded global `youtube-audit` for both Claude and Codex from a transcript-only content critique into an evidence-first channel audit contract. It now requires full `yt-dlp` metadata, a venv-aware `youtube-transcript-api` import check, raw metadata/transcript persistence under `research/youtube/data/<slug>/`, and portfolio/performance fields: views, likes, comments, views/day, views/minute, top-video concentration, archetype, content role, packaging signals, and cleanup candidates.
- Added `packs/creator-media/` with `PACK.md` plus mirrored Claude/Codex skills: `youtube-channel-audit`, `youtube-portfolio`, `youtube-peer-benchmark`, `creator-positioning`, `content-programming`, `series-spec`, `product-led-media-map`, and `creator-metrics-review`.
- Registered `creator-media` in `scripts/pack.sh` aliases/project type handling, `README.md`, and `docs/skills-reference.md`. The docs name the intended validation target shapes: `@GeorgeLe`, `WeeklyG`, and `WeeklySOTA`.
- Validation: `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken` passed; `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing` passed with 255 versioned skills; `bash -n scripts/pack.sh` passed; grep checks confirmed target use cases, raw-data paths, and performance fields are present.

## 2026-04-30 — Refresh documentation priority roadmap

- Ran `$research-roadmap` after Phase 11 closure. Classified this repository as a devtool-style skills/tooling project with canonical `research/`, `specs/`, and `tasks/` roots.
- Added `tasks/todo.md` § "Priority Documentation Todo" with three immediately actionable documentation items: missing `research/devtool-positioning.md`, blocked missing `research/devtool-monetization.md`, and `$spec-drift fix all` because implementation/docs changed on 2026-04-30 while canonical specs last changed on 2026-04-22.
- Marked the `/research-roadmap` queue item complete and preserved the user-authored `creator-media research pack` task as the next product workstream.

## 2026-04-30 — Make Codex `$run` approval implicit by default

- Updated `global/codex/run/SKILL.md` so `$run` presents the execution plan, updates `update_plan`, then proceeds by default. A `$run` invocation is now treated as implicit approval for the next planned step or scoped phase.
- Preserved explicit confirmation for separate safety decisions: destructive commands, production deploys, paid/external account actions, credential/secret handling beyond the project contract, execution-profile downgrades, blockers, and material scope changes.
- Updated Codex workflow documentation plus `$ship` and `$plan-phase` references so they no longer describe a normal `$run` approval gate.
- Added a lesson from session-history analysis: routine `$run` approval prompts are friction and should not be reintroduced.

## 2026-04-29 — Ship pre-spec planning skills and concept-brief integration

- Added 3 new global skills (concept-exploration, ui-interview, ux-variation) for both Claude and Codex, covering the pre-spec planning workflow: concept → ICP → journey → UX variation → UI spec → spec-interview → roadmap.
- Updated roadmap and research-roadmap skills (both CLIs) to add journey/UX/UI planning gates — user-facing specs now require journey-map, ux-variation, and ui-interview artifacts before entering the roadmap pipeline.
- Updated business-app pack skills (icp, competitive-analysis, journey-map) to integrate concept-brief as input source and prefer `research/{app}/concept-brief.md` when present.
- Updated canonical-workflow-report and codex-workflow docs to reflect the expanded entry path through concept-exploration and research skills.
- Fixed spec-interview heading format: added canonical section heading template (Overview, Goals, Non-Goals, etc.) to prevent numbered headings; renamed install-workflow-orchestration → provision-agentic-config across all references.
- Minor linter tweaks to spec-interview wording ("chosen experience plan").

## 2026-04-25 — Add Assumptions Manifest to spec-interview skill

- Analyzed full Claude/Codex session history (~8,120 + 3,401 records) to find cases where agent assumptions during plan-interview and spec-interview sessions caused downstream refactors or project restarts.
- Identified 5 recurring patterns: unprobed product-identity assumptions (bismarck v0.4 tool-vs-game → sunset), feature integration risk not surfaced (loadoutworks 3D breaking 2D builder → full rebuild), deployment readiness assumed (bismarck v0.4 deployment day disaster), data model assumptions causing phase rewrites (poke monorepo phase 4), and UX direction inferred from technical descriptions (sidebar nav, loading skeletons).
- Root cause: spec-interview skill lacked a structured step to surface and validate the agent's own assumptions before probing. The agent's mental model was invisible to the user.
- Added new **Step 2: Assumptions Manifest** to both Claude and Codex spec-interview skills. The agent must now compile a tagged assumption list (`[from spec]`, `[from codebase]`, `[from research]`, `[inferred]`) covering 6 mandatory categories (product identity, core experience, technical foundation, integration risk, UX direction, data model) and block the interview until the user reviews it.
- Spec output now includes an **Assumptions & Risks** appendix. Interview logs record the full manifest with user corrections.
- Updated all 4 skill files (2 repo canonical + 2 user-local via hardlinks). Validated with `skill-deps.sh --broken` and `skill-versions.sh --missing`.

## 2026-04-23 - Add global dogfood skill

- Added mirrored global `dogfood` skills for Codex and Claude. The skill derives operator-run product scenarios from specs, journey maps, user stories, task docs, and pack-specific research, then writes UAT-style instructions for a human operator rather than running the product itself.
- The workflow resolves project type from `.agents/project.json` or repo signals, loads business-app/devtool/game/generic evidence, infers active-use cadence, generates 3-7 concrete scenarios, and routes operator execution to `tasks/manual-todo.md` under `## Dogfood Operator Scenarios`.
- Added `research/dogfood-audit.md` as the canonical audit output with scenario matrix, evidence checklist, and operator result logs. Recurring dogfood obligations are routed to `tasks/recurring-todo.md` only when a cadence is useful.
- Registered `dogfood` in the global core README list and in both Claude/Codex `$skills` / `/skills` Evaluate mappings.
- Verified with `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, and an ASCII scan of both new skill files.

## 2026-04-22 — Create `research/devtool-adoption.md`

- The devtool research chain's adoption step (`tasks/todo.md:1020`) was the next unchecked item after `$devtool-dx-journey` shipped earlier today. `research/devtool-adoption.md` did not exist.
- Ran `$devtool-adoption` per `packs/devtool/claude/devtool-adoption/SKILL.md`. Produced `research/devtool-adoption.md` with the six required sections — adoption loops, examples, templates, community channels, proof artifacts, activation metrics — each anchored to concrete repo paths and cross-linked to the prior three research docs for continuity.
- Grounded honest-state findings: absence of `.github/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` confirmed by filesystem check; `tasks/history.md` functions as the de facto changelog (1,083 lines, near-daily cadence); no telemetry or community channels instrumented. Proposed three free/local activation signals (ship-cycles/week, user-authored-skill ratio, `tasks/lessons.md` growth) as honest metrics a maintainer could extract without adding network telemetry.
- Ticked `tasks/todo.md:1020` (`$devtool-adoption`). No code, script, or spec edits. Archive-first not required (new file). Next unblocked chain step: `$devtool-positioning` at `tasks/todo.md:1021`.

## 2026-04-22 — Create `research/devtool-dx-journey.md`

- The devtool research chain's dx-journey step (`tasks/todo.md:1019`) was the next unchecked item after `$devtool-integration-map` shipped earlier today. `research/devtool-dx-journey.md` did not exist.
- Created `research/devtool-dx-journey.md` grounded in this repo's actual developer experience rather than generic DX boilerplate: install from `install.sh` (two-layer global + project, intentional no-pack-global decision, symmetrical `--uninstall`, absent CLI-presence check); quickstart from `/pack` / `$pack` guided setup plus the explicit CLI-restart round-trip called out in `README.md:51` and `docs/packs.md:43`; first success as a `/run` or `$run` cycle that exercises plan-mode-first, ship-one-step, and `commit-and-push-by-feature` together; error recovery via `scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, `scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `pack.sh refresh` + CLI restart, `$spec-drift`, `$reconcile-dev-docs`, plus the honest gaps (no rollback, no skill-behavior harness, no hot reload); production adoption as the ship-one-step loop on `master` with dated `tasks/history.md` entries as the live changelog and archive-first as manual discipline; team rollout covering the commit-`.agents/project.json`-and-regenerate contract, shared checkout-path standardization, per-developer mode override, 2x mirror tax, restart chore compounding, and the fork-as-registry pattern; retention via plan-mode-first muscle memory, ship-one-step as the unit of progress, tasks-as-docs, the `tasks/lessons.md` self-improvement loop, gradual hybrid adoption, and `create-skill` + `pack promote` turning the library into a personal dotfile — plus honest anti-retention signals (restart chore, silent mirror rot, terminology cliff, long operating-modes doc, no version pin).
- All seven required sections present per `packs/devtool/claude/devtool-dx-journey/SKILL.md`: Install, Quickstart, First success, Error recovery, Production adoption, Team rollout, Retention.
- Cross-linked continuity with `research/devtool-user-map.md` (audience) and `research/devtool-integration-map.md` (setup mechanics and migration risks), reusing their anchors instead of re-deriving friction points.
- Archive-first not required — new file, no existing canonical doc replaced.
- Marked `$devtool-dx-journey` complete in `tasks/todo.md:1019`. Unblocks `$devtool-adoption` at `tasks/todo.md:1020`.

## 2026-04-22 — Create `research/devtool-integration-map.md`

- The devtool research chain's integration-map step (`tasks/todo.md:1018`) was the next unchecked item after `$devtool-user-map` shipped earlier today. `research/devtool-integration-map.md` did not exist.
- Created `research/devtool-integration-map.md` grounded in this repo's observable integration surface rather than generic devtool boilerplate: required integrations from `install.sh`, `scripts/pack.sh`, and `scripts/agent-mode.sh` (bash, git, symlinks, Claude Code and/or Codex CLI, writable `$HOME`, `.agents/project.json`); ecosystem assumptions from the two-CLI-only install path, local-first execution, `main`/`master` default, and the explicit `No GitHub Actions` rule in `CLAUDE.md`; setup path as clone → `./install.sh` → `scripts/pack.sh install <pack>` → optional `set-mode` → CLI restart; compatibility constraints naming WSL requirement, synced-filesystem fragility, checkout-path coupling, dual-CLI parity by convention only, and Claude-only `/delegate`; migration risks covering vendor concentration, 2x mirror maintenance tax, no rollback tooling, manual archive-first discipline, approval-packet schema drift, and absent skill-behavior test harness.
- All five required sections present per `packs/devtool/claude/devtool-integration-map/SKILL.md`: Required integrations, Ecosystem assumptions, Setup path, Compatibility constraints, Migration risks.
- Cross-linked continuity with `research/devtool-user-map.md` for audience framing and reused its "Adoption blockers" entries as migration-risk evidence rather than re-deriving them.
- Archive-first not required — new file, no existing canonical doc replaced.
- Marked `$devtool-integration-map` complete in `tasks/todo.md:1018`. Unblocks `$devtool-dx-journey` at `tasks/todo.md:1019`.

## 2026-04-22 — Create `research/devtool-user-map.md`

- The devtool research chain (`tasks/todo.md:1017–1023`) was blocked because the canonical `research/devtool-user-map.md` did not exist. `research/` directory was also absent on disk.
- Created `research/devtool-user-map.md` grounded in this repo's own observable signals rather than generic devtool boilerplate: audience from `README.md` (solo builders, embedded contributors, hybrid-mode orchestrators), economic buyers from upstream CLI dependencies (Claude Max / Codex subscriptions), maintainers from `CLAUDE.md` + `tasks/history.md` cadence, operators from `scripts/pack.sh` surfaces, and adoption blockers from real friction (dual Claude/Codex maintenance tax, symlink install + CLI restart requirement, long `docs/operating-modes.md`, absent `CONTRIBUTING.md`, asymmetric `/delegate`, no skill-contract test harness under the explicit `No GitHub Actions` rule).
- All seven required sections present per `packs/devtool/claude/devtool-user-map/SKILL.md`: Developer users, Economic buyers, Champions, Maintainers, Operators, Use cases, Adoption blockers.
- Archive-first not required — new file, no existing canonical doc replaced.
- Marked `$devtool-user-map` complete in `tasks/todo.md:1017`. Unblocks `$devtool-integration-map` at `tasks/todo.md:1018`.

## 2026-04-22 — Document `pack.sh list-packs` as internal Codex `$run` subcommand

- `scripts/pack.sh list-packs` is advertised in the script's own `--help` (`scripts/pack.sh:19`) and dispatched at `scripts/pack.sh:358`, but neither `README.md` nor `docs/skills-reference.md` mentioned it. The only external consumer is `global/codex/run/SKILL.md`. Users reading the reference docs could not distinguish it from the human-facing `list`.
- Added a short annotation paragraph after the pack-commands block in `docs/skills-reference.md` § "Project Pack Commands" describing `list-packs` as an internal subcommand used by Codex `$run` routing: prints enabled packs from `.agents/project.json` one per line with no decoration, distinct from `list`. Points interactive users to `list` or `status`.
- Mirrored the annotation in `README.md` § "Project Packs" directly below the pack-commands block, pointing `$run`-internal readers at `global/codex/run/SKILL.md`.
- Did not add `list-packs` to the bash code blocks themselves; those continue to advertise only the human-facing subcommands.
- Marked `$reconcile-dev-docs fix pack-command docs` complete in `tasks/todo.md:1016`.

## 2026-04-22 — Document Claude-only `delegate` in skills reference

- `global/claude/delegate/SKILL.md` exists and is central to live Claude→Codex hybrid-mode delegation, but neither `README.md` nor `docs/skills-reference.md` mentioned it. `grep -in delegate` on both files returned nothing, so a Codex user scanning the reference docs could reasonably expect a symmetric `$delegate` that does not exist (no `global/codex/delegate/` directory).
- Added a "Claude-only Global Skills" subsection to `docs/skills-reference.md` under the global-core table, with a single-row table marking `delegate` as Claude-only and a short blurb positioning it as the synchronous sibling of `/handoff --target=codex` (hybrid-only, falls cleanly into pre-start-failure if `codex` is missing). Cross-linked `global/claude/delegate/SKILL.md` and `docs/operating-modes.md`.
- Mirrored the asymmetry in `README.md` § "Global Core" with a "Claude-only global skills" subsection that names `delegate`, explains the hybrid-only invariant, and redirects Codex users to `/handoff --target=codex` for the async variant.
- Kept the existing bilateral global-skill listings untouched so the rest of the reference still describes only symmetric skills.
- Marked `$reconcile-dev-docs fix skills-reference` complete in `tasks/todo.md:1015`.

## 2026-04-22 — Banner legacy `kanban.mjs` specs

- Five `specs/kanban-*.md` files (`board-flag-kanban-search.md`, `kanban-multi-user.md`, `kanban-production-test-plan.md`, `kanban-command-test-coverage.md`, `kanban-offline-queue-soft-delete.md`) still described `kanban.mjs` as the primary kanban entry point. Active path is `poketo kanban` (headless HTTP); `kanban.mjs` is fallback/admin-only per `specs/poketo-headless-auth-migration.md:164,306`.
- Added a 3-line `> Status:` blockquote banner directly under each spec's H1, identifying it as targeting the legacy `kanban.mjs` fallback path and pointing readers to `specs/poketo-headless-auth-migration.md` for the active path. Technical bodies left untouched (still valid for the fallback path and historical reference).
- `specs/poketo-headless-auth-migration.md` already declared the legacy/active split; no edit needed.
- Marked `$spec-drift fix kanban legacy specs` complete in `tasks/todo.md:1014`.

## 2026-04-22 — Refresh stale canonical workflow report

- `docs/canonical-workflow-report.md` (dated 2026-04-19) still said Phase 11 Steps 7–11 were "planned but not fully wired" and listed Phase 11 Step 7 as "active planning work", but Phase 11 completed 2026-04-19 per `tasks/roadmap.md:25,33`.
- Chose in-place refresh over demote-and-snapshot: the drift was localized to the scope line and the "Current Gaps And Active Work" section, so a light edit was sufficient and preserved the document's otherwise-still-accurate body.
- Updated `docs/canonical-workflow-report.md:3–4` to reflect Phase 11 completion and point readers at `docs/operating-modes.md` as the authoritative operating-model reference. Added a "(refreshed 2026-04-22)" date annotation.
- Rewrote `docs/canonical-workflow-report.md:484–494` to list Steps 7–11 as shipped and redirect remaining drift/follow-up questions to `tasks/todo.md` + `tasks/history.md`. Dropped the stale "`docs/operating-modes.md` still says no skill consumes the mode signal" note, which Step 11 has since resolved.
- Marked `$spec-drift fix docs/canonical-workflow-report.md` complete in `tasks/todo.md:1013`. `grep -n "Phase 11 Step 7\|not fully wired\|active planning work" docs/canonical-workflow-report.md` now returns nothing.

## 2026-04-22 — Tighten guide routing for task-doc reconciliation

- Root cause: roadmap and ship next-step routing treated any "manual" or `tasks/manual-todo.md` cleanup as `/guide`-eligible. That introduced a bad downstream handoff in `lexcorp-war-room` (`$guide reconcile manual-todo`) even though the guide skill correctly targets GUI/service-console work.
- Updated Claude and Codex `roadmap`, `ship`, `ship-end`, `plan-phase`, and `run` skills to distinguish external manual work (DNS/OAuth/service dashboards/auth/production smoke checks) from task-doc bookkeeping.
- Added explicit routing for stale `tasks/manual-todo.md` cleanup and task ledger reconciliation to `/reconcile-dev-docs fix tasks` / `$reconcile-dev-docs fix tasks` or a direct dev-doc audit.
- Hardened Claude and Codex `guide` skills to reject requests like "reconcile manual-todo", "audit stale manual tasks", and "check off completed todo items" instead of producing a guide.
- Decision: no new skill needed; `reconcile-dev-docs` already owns the gap. The fix was routing language and a clearer guide non-goal.

## 2026-04-22 — Reconcile kanban-archive docs with `poketo-kanban --archive`

- `tasks/roadmap.md` (Phase 4 overview row, step 2 heading, milestone bullet) and `specs/poketo-headless-auth-migration.md:66` still described `/kanban-archive` as a standalone skill; the standalone skill was merged into `poketo-kanban --archive` (see `tasks/history.md` Phase 4 entry; ground truth in `packs/poketowork-kanban/{claude,codex}/poketo-kanban/SKILL.md:103`).
- Rewrote `tasks/roadmap.md:18` (overview row) and `tasks/roadmap.md:155–162` (step 2 heading + milestone) to describe archive mode on `poketo-kanban`, preserving the `[x]` complete state and adding a brief note about the standalone→merged history.
- Annotated `specs/poketo-headless-auth-migration.md:66` with `(merged into `poketo-kanban --archive`; path no longer present)` rather than removing the archival migration row.
- Left archival files (`tasks/history.md` prior entries, `docs/phases/phase-4.md`, `docs/phases/kanban-validation.md`) frozen per the same archive-first principle used in the previous two drift fixes.
- Marked `$spec-drift fix kanban archive docs` complete in `tasks/todo.md`. `grep -rn "kanban-archive" tasks/roadmap.md specs/poketo-headless-auth-migration.md` now shows only annotated historical references, no prose implying a standalone skill.

## 2026-04-22 — Reconcile `code-quality` pack docs with shipped skills

- `README.md` and `specs/code-quality-skill-pack.md` still described `code-quality` as a single-skill pack (only `extract-shared-types`); the pack has also shipped `quality-sweep` since commit `975c823` (2026-04-16).
- Updated `README.md:149` to list both skills and summarize `quality-sweep`. Rewrote `specs/code-quality-skill-pack.md` summary, folder layout, naming, skill specifications (adding a `quality-sweep` subsection mirroring `packs/code-quality/{claude,codex}/quality-sweep/SKILL.md`), implementation notes, and acceptance criteria to cover both skills.
- Mirrored behavior from the shipped `SKILL.md` files rather than inventing it: audit/fix/full modes, eight audit lanes, triage buckets, subagent policy, non-goals around behavior/public-API/error-handling preservation.
- Marked `$spec-drift fix code-quality docs` complete in `tasks/todo.md`. Archival references in `tasks/history.md`, `tasks/todo.md` historical notes, and `specs/drift-report.md` are intentionally left as-is.

## 2026-04-22 — Fix approval-packet section anchors

- Phase 11 renamed the operating-modes doc heading from `## Approval / Delegation Packet` to `## Approval packet`; three in-repo references still pointed at the old anchor.
- Updated `tasks/approved-plan.md:3`, `scripts/approved-plan.sh:213` (heredoc template for generated mirrors), and `global/codex/run/SKILL.md:144` to the new anchor.
- Marked `$spec-drift fix approval-packet references` complete in `tasks/todo.md`. Remaining `Approval / Delegation Packet` hits in `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/history.md`, and `specs/drift-report.md` are archival/historical and intentionally preserved.

## 2026-04-22 — Harden `/run` agent-team dispatch against stale step prose

- Fixed a real blocker hit in a downstream repo (Pitwall) where `/run` correctly identified an `agent-team` profile but stopped because the Step 5.1 body still contained legacy advisory text (*"do not implement… through a single /run"*, *"use /delegate"*) from before the auto-dispatch feature (commit `de3d506`) shipped.
- Updated `global/claude/run/SKILL.md` § "Execution Profile Handling": the `agent-team` bullet now explicitly says do **not** stop for legacy advisory prose in the phase/step body — trust the `### Execution Profile` metadata (post-`/patch-exec-profile`) and only stop if lane specs cannot be resolved. Added a Next-Step Routing rule: don't recommend `/delegate` as a workaround for agent-team.
- Captured the pattern in `tasks/lessons.md` (2026-04-22 entry) so a future `/run` in a repo with stale step prose won't repeat the mistake.

## 2026-04-20 — Add `create-skill` global skill

- Added `create-skill` to `global/claude` and `global/codex` as a meta-skill that scaffolds new **user-local** skills directly into `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` and `~/.codex/skills/<name>/` as real directories (never inside the agentic-skills repo).
- The skill refuses to shadow repo-managed symlinks, mirrors to both assistants on request, and closes by offering to **promote** the scaffolded skill into a user's personal fork of agentic-skills (copy only — commit/push left to the user).
- Documented the upstream-safety model: plain clones cannot push to the shared repo, forks push only to the user's own remote, and the skill never writes into this repo's `global/` or `packs/` trees.
- Registered `create-skill` in the README global-core list and installed symlinks via `install.sh`.

## 2026-04-20 - Fix scale-audit next-step drift

- Aligned Claude and Codex `packs/business-app/*/scale-audit` guidance with `docs/skill-next-step-contracts.md`.
- Replaced unconditional roadmap-first next steps with state-based recommendations: `spec-interview [top blocker]` when enterprise hard blockers lack full specs, missing context skills when required inputs are absent, and `roadmap` only when blockers are already specced or tracked.
- Added `specs/drift-report.md` for the fix-mode audit trail and marked the `$spec-drift fix packs/business-app/*/scale-audit` priority item complete in `tasks/todo.md`.

## 2026-04-20 - Reconcile Phase 11 task docs

- Resolved the Phase 11 task-doc contradiction where `tasks/todo.md` still contained unchecked archived acceptance criteria even though `tasks/roadmap.md`, `tasks/history.md`, and `tasks/verify-phase-11.md` all recorded Phase 11 as complete.
- Checked the Phase 11 top-level acceptance criteria and archived Step 4 through Step 11 / Verify acceptance checklists in `tasks/todo.md`, leaving the active Priority Documentation Todo queue as the only unchecked task surface.
- Added `tasks/reconciliation-report.md` with resolved, deferred, and remaining findings, and marked `$reconcile-dev-docs fix tasks` complete in the queue.

## 2026-04-20 — Move `mvp-gap` to research outputs

- Reclassified Claude and Codex `mvp-gap` as a research skill and changed its canonical output from `specs/mvp-gap.md` to `research/mvp-gap.md` (app-scoped: `research/{app}/mvp-gap.md`).
- Updated `mvp-gap` next-step guidance so the primary follow-up is `spec-interview [top gap]` whenever the audit finds an unspecced priority gap; `roadmap` is primary only after priority gaps already have specs.
- Updated dependent readers (`brainstorm`, `competitive-analysis`, `scale-audit`, and `research-roadmap`) to look for `research/mvp-gap.md` instead of treating the audit as an implementation spec.

## 2026-04-20 — Audit skill next-step contracts

- Audited all 205 `SKILL.md` files under `global/` and `packs/` for command-style next-step references and semantic next-step validity across expected end states.
- Added `docs/skill-next-step-contracts.md` as the canonical contract for valid recommendations, covering universal rules, expected end-state families, and multi-state rules for research and planning skills.
- Fixed concept-validation `competitive-analysis` next steps so `Proceed to ICP`, `Pivot concept`, and `Abandon` each have a valid recommendation path.
- Fixed `experiment` next-step guidance so a newly designed experiment recommends running the experiment, while validated/invalidated/inconclusive outcomes live under `## Decision Rules`.
- Fixed `reconcile-research` next-step logic for fully resolved and no-work end states.
- Added guardrail wording to downstream-impact-aware skills so `reconcile-research` and stale annotations are selected only after the proposed output has an actual `None`/`Minor`/`Major` impact classification.
- Updated `docs/skills-reference.md` to point readers to the next-step contract.

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 11 Step 13 — Close the two `jq`-dependency gaps

- Closed the two non-blocking `jq`-dependency gaps logged in `docs/operating-modes.md` § "Gaps surfaced by Step 8". Both were documentary — runtime behavior already clean via `scripts/approved-plan.sh:21` `require_jq_write`, which dies with `ERROR: jq required for write operations. Install with: brew install jq (macOS) or apt install jq (Debian/Ubuntu).` on every write subcommand.
- **Gap 1 — `handoff --target=codex`.** Added a `jq`-required note to step 5's preamble in `global/claude/handoff/SKILL.md`. Covers 5.4 (`draft`) and 5.5 (pretty-print) — `draft` dies first via `require_jq_write`, so users never reach 5.5 when `jq` is absent.
- **Gap 2 — `codex/run --execute-approved`.** Strengthened step 6c of `global/codex/run/SKILL.md` to spell out the exact `require_jq_write` error text users see. § "Constraints" byte-preserved.
- **Audit cleanup.** Both `⚠ gap — follow-up` cells in `docs/operating-modes.md`'s audit table updated to cite the new skill-side declarations (zero cells remain). Open gap bullets replaced with a dated resolution line + strikethrough of the originals, preserving the audit trail.
- Decision: declare, don't fallback. `jq` is trivially installable; a `jq`-free parser would duplicate 30+ lines of JSON handling for no benefit.
- Contract untouched: no edits to `scripts/approved-plan.sh`, `specs/approved-plan.schema.json`, `scripts/agent-mode.sh`, `scripts/pack.sh`, `CLAUDE.md`, any other `SKILL.md`, or any pack file.
- Verified: zero `⚠ gap — follow-up` cells in the audit table; new `jq`-required sentences present in both SKILL.md files; `bash -n scripts/approved-plan.sh` still parses.
- Checked off Step 13 in `tasks/todo.md`, appended a Step 13 Summary, and updated `tasks/roadmap.md` Phase 11 section with a Step 13 tail addendum (phase retains ✓).

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 11 Step 12 — Gap fixes from Verify

- Closed the two non-blocking gaps Phase 11 Verify surfaced (`tasks/verify-phase-11.md` § "Gaps surfaced by Verify"). Tail micro-step of Phase 11; no mechanism redesign, just guard parity + doc clarification.
- **Gap 1 — source-state guard on `mark-stale`.** Added a guard block to `scripts/approved-plan.sh cmd_mark_stale` mirroring the proven `cmd_mark_uncertain` pattern. Only `approved` now transitions to `stale`; `draft`, `consumed`, `stale`, `superseded`, and `uncertain` each exit non-zero with `cannot mark-stale: lifecycle=<state> (only 'approved' may transition to 'stale')`. Retroactive rewrites of terminal history (e.g. `consumed → stale`, which Verify authoring hit by accident) are no longer possible. Uses `fail` (not `die`) for consistency with the sibling `mark-uncertain` rejection phrasing.
- **Gap 2 — hybrid back-to-back mirror-commit prerequisite.** Added one row to `docs/operating-modes.md` § "Degraded-path audit" documenting that after a `consume` rewrites `tasks/approved-plan.md`, the next `draft` fails with `dirty path outside allowlist: tasks/approved-plan.md` unless the mirror is committed or `--allow-dirty tasks/approved-plan.md` is passed. Added a one-line in-context note to `global/claude/delegate/SKILL.md` step 2's `--allow-dirty` discussion so `/delegate` invokers see it without opening the audit.
- Contract untouched: no edits to `specs/approved-plan.schema.json` (enum already had all five states — this is a pure runtime guard), `scripts/agent-mode.sh`, `scripts/pack.sh`, `CLAUDE.md`, any other `SKILL.md`, or any pack file. Codex side (`global/codex/**`) untouched — `mark-stale` is Claude-side tooling per Step 6 design.
- Verified with fixture packets under `/tmp/apkstale12/`, mirroring Step 6's approach (`tasks/history.md:73`, `/tmp/apktest6/`). Six cases: happy path (`approved → stale`, `ok` exit 0, atomic flip) + rejection for each of `draft`, `consumed`, `stale`, `superseded`, `uncertain` (exit 1, expected reason, packet unchanged). Doc edits verified by grep of the new audit row + the new `--allow-dirty` sentence.
- Checked off Step 12 in `tasks/todo.md`, appended a Step 12 Summary + archived Active Step Plan, and updated `tasks/roadmap.md` Phase 11 section with a Step 12 tail addendum (phase retains ✓).

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 11 Verify — Three-mode sample-workflow walkthrough

- Exercised every Phase 11 mode + packet mechanism end-to-end under each of the three operating modes (`claude-only`, `codex-only`, `hybrid`) plus two degraded-path spot checks. Created `tasks/verify-phase-11.md` (committed) with live shell output for every `scripts/agent-mode.sh` and `scripts/approved-plan.sh` invocation, quoted recommendation copy from the Step 7 `global/{claude,codex}/run/SKILL.md` "Mode-aware next-step recommendation" blocks, and anchor-level cross-references to `docs/operating-modes.md` §§ "Mode-signal resolution", "Approval packet — Lifecycle / Safety classification / Freshness checks", and "Degraded-path audit".
- `claude-only` + `codex-only`: resolver emits the correct mode; `.agents/` directory never materializes; no packet written across either run. Each mode's terminal skill emits exactly one in-mode recommendation line (never crosses to the unavailable CLI).
- `hybrid`: drove the full `draft → approved → consumed` packet lifecycle via `scripts/approved-plan.sh draft → approve → check → consume`. Captured `status` at every transition. The regenerated `tasks/approved-plan.md` mirror correctly excludes JSON-only fields (`allowed_dirty_paths`, `notes`) per the Step 3 safety classification.
- Spot check (a): `/delegate` mode-mismatch contract verified by quoting three independent declarations in `global/claude/delegate/SKILL.md` (lines 17, 25, 70) — non-zero exit with `mode-mismatch:` reason, no packet mutation. Consistent with the observed absence of `.agents/` under the `claude-only` resolver run.
- Spot check (b): drafted a packet with `--ttl 1`, approved, slept 3s; `check` returned non-zero with `stale: TTL expired (age=3s, ttl=1s)` and `mark-stale` flipped the lifecycle atomically — confirming the TTL freshness check from Step 4.
- Commit policy decision: no "fake work" commits on `master`. The walkthrough exercised the machinery directly; no external task existed for skills to mutate. Only bookkeeping commits land (evidence file + task doc updates).
- Gaps surfaced (non-blocking, logged under `### Gaps surfaced by Verify` in `tasks/verify-phase-11.md`): (1) `mark-stale` accepted a `consumed` source state during spot-check authoring, unlike `mark-uncertain` which explicitly rejects all non-`approved` sources — a follow-up should align the source-state guard; (2) back-to-back hybrid cycles require committing `tasks/approved-plan.md` between runs (otherwise the next `draft` sees a dirty tree) — expected UX, but not documented as a hybrid-flow prerequisite in the degraded-path audit.
- Contract untouched: no edits to any `SKILL.md`, `scripts/*.sh`, `specs/approved-plan.schema.json`, `docs/operating-modes.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or any pack file. Verify is empirical per plan; findings get logged, not fixed in this micro-step.
- Checked off the final Phase 11 Verify item in `tasks/todo.md`, appended a Verify Summary, archived the Active Step Plan, and added a Phase 11 ✓ section to `tasks/roadmap.md` (previously absent — Phase 11 lived only in `todo.md`/`history.md`). **Phase 11 is complete: all 11 steps + Verify shipped.**

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 11 Step 11 — `docs/operating-modes.md` as authoritative reference

- Expanded `docs/operating-modes.md` from a 200-line thin doc + appended audit tables into a ~280-line authoritative reference. Added `## Mode-signal resolution` (env > `.agents/project.json` > unset precedence truth table, writer citation at `pack.sh set-mode`, unset semantics, and the "do not restate precedence in skill copy" invariant). Reorganized `## Approval packet` into four subsections — Fields (citing `specs/approved-plan.schema.json` as the authoritative contract rather than duplicating it), Lifecycle (ASCII diagram + transitions-to-writers table mapping `draft`/`approve`/`consume`/`mark-stale`/`supersede`/`mark-uncertain` to their lifecycle edges), Safety classification (`.md`-safe vs JSON-only, projection enforced by `consume`), and Freshness checks (the six `check` tests in cheapest-first order).
- Preserved Step 8 (`## Degraded-path audit`, 19 rows + Gaps subsection), Step 9 (`## Pack emphasis`, 34 global skill rows + 8 pack rows), and Step 10 (`### Codex $run routing`) tables byte-identically. Verified by diffing the section from `HEAD:docs/operating-modes.md` — only the trailing status line differed (by design, see below).
- Added `## Migrating from the parity-mirror model` — ~25 lines of pointer-level orientation covering `pack.sh set-mode` for declaring mode, the pack emphasis tables for role-based pack selection, `/delegate` as the in-session hybrid execution path replacing manual CLI switching, `/handoff --target=codex` for async handoffs, and the deliberate "unset is a mode too" semantics that leaves skills presenting all three options. No tutorial depth — skills already document their own workflows, this section just names the entry points.
- Replaced the trailing `Status: Phase 11 Step 1 — thin doc … Step 10 …` incremental line with a single `Phase 11 Steps 1–11 complete: authoritative operating-model reference.` Opened `## Gaps surfaced by Step 11` and explicitly closed it with "None" — no new spec-level gaps found during the docs pass.
- Contract untouched: no edits to `specs/approved-plan.schema.json`, `scripts/agent-mode.sh`, `scripts/approved-plan.sh`, `scripts/pack.sh`, any `SKILL.md` (global or pack), any pack wrapper, `CLAUDE.md`, or `tasks/roadmap.md`. Only `docs/operating-modes.md`, `tasks/todo.md`, and `tasks/history.md` touched — matches Step 11's docs-only scope.
- Verification: `git diff HEAD docs/operating-modes.md` shows tables under `## Degraded-path audit` and `## Pack emphasis` are byte-identical in content; the new `## Mode-signal resolution` precedence matches `scripts/agent-mode.sh` behavior (env > file > unset, invalid value in either source exits non-zero); every lifecycle-diagram edge maps to a real `approved-plan.sh` subcommand and every subcommand appears in the diagram; migration guide cites `pack.sh set-mode`, `/delegate`, `/handoff --target=codex`, `$run --execute-approved` by name without re-describing their internals.
- Checked off Step 11 in `tasks/todo.md`, added a Step 11 Summary, and archived the Step 11 Active Step Plan in place. The Phase 11 final **Verify** acceptance item (three-mode sample-workflow walkthrough) rolled to its own deferred micro-step — it requires a real workflow run, not a docs task.

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 11 Step 10 — Pack-aware `$run` routing on Codex

- Extended `global/codex/run/SKILL.md` § "Mode-aware next-step recommendation" with a new `### Pack-aware routing` subsection. Resolver order: (a) resolve agent mode via `./scripts/agent-mode.sh` (Step 7, unchanged), (b) resolve enabled packs via `./scripts/pack.sh list-packs`, (c) when the recommendation would emit `$run` / `$ship` / `$ship-end`, check whether any enabled pack ships a matching `-kanban` variant under `packs/<pack>/codex/` and emit the kanban invocation if so; otherwise emit the global default. Candidate packs cited inline: `business-app-kanban`, `devtool-kanban`, `game-kanban`, `poketowork-kanban` — all tagged `Both` in Step 9's Packs table, the load-bearing citation.
- Added `list-packs` subcommand to `scripts/pack.sh` (one newline-separated enabled-pack name per line, no decoration) that reuses the existing `read_enabled_packs` function — no duplicated JSON parsing. Silent on missing or malformed `.agents/project.json` (exit 0, empty output), matching the plan's degraded-path contract. Usage help updated.
- Documented the degraded path explicitly in the SKILL.md subsection: missing or malformed `.agents/project.json` (or non-zero exit from `list-packs`) → silent fallback to the global-default recommendation with a single inline comment `pack-lookup: skipped (no project.json)` appended to the recommendation line. Ambiguity (two enabled packs ship the same `-kanban` variant) → recommend the first in `enabled_packs` order and note the tie inline, never prompt. Scope fenced: recommendation-text routing only — `$run --execute-approved` still consumes `.agents/approved-plan.json` verbatim regardless of pack routing.
- Added a short `### Codex `$run` routing` subsection under `## Pack emphasis` in `docs/operating-modes.md` (above the closing `---` status line) that names the resolver and points at `global/codex/run/SKILL.md` § "Pack-aware routing" for the full behavior. Status line updated to mention Step 10.
- Contract untouched: no edits to `specs/approved-plan.schema.json`, `scripts/agent-mode.sh`, `scripts/approved-plan.sh`, `global/claude/run/SKILL.md` (Claude-side pack routing deferred to Step 11+), any other skill's workflow, any pack skill, or the Step 8 degraded-path audit / Step 9 pack emphasis tables.
- Verified `list-packs` against three cases: no `.agents/project.json` → empty output, exit 0; `enabled_packs: ["business-app-kanban"]` → emits `business-app-kanban`; malformed JSON → empty output, exit 0 (silent degraded path, consistent with SKILL.md subsection's documented fallback).
- Checked off Step 10 in `tasks/todo.md`, appended a Step 10 Summary, and rolled the Active Step Plan to Step 11 (authoritative `docs/operating-modes.md` expansion — sketch). Step 10's prior Active Step Plan is archived in place for reference.

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 11 Step 9 — Pack emphasis split by CLI role

- Appended `## Pack emphasis` to `docs/operating-modes.md` with two authoritative tables. **Global skills** (34 rows — one per unique skill name across `global/claude/` + `global/codex/`) tags every skill with a single primary role: `Claude-orchestration` (framing, interviews, strategy, research synthesis), `Codex-execution` (implementation, reconciliation, validation, shipping), or `Both` (genuinely spans). **Packs** (8 rows — one per directory under `packs/`) tags each pack with the same three-value role, noting inheritance where kanban variants inherit from a base pack.
- Every skill row verified against the skill's `SKILL.md` `description` frontmatter field. Starting hypothesis from the plan was re-checked, not rubber-stamped. "Both" rows (`branch-lifecycle`, `handoff`, `hygiene`, `migrate`, `pack`, `run`) each carry an inline rationale — no default-assignments.
- Pack distribution: base packs (`business-app`, `devtool`, `game`) are all Claude-orchestration (strategy/framing/research skills); `code-quality` is Codex-execution (behavior-preserving refactor mutation); kanban variants (`business-app-kanban`, `devtool-kanban`, `game-kanban`) are Both (inherit base pack orchestration + add kanban run/ship execution variants); `poketowork-kanban` is Both natively (no base pack to inherit from, mixes orchestration and execution skills directly).
- Added a single-line role tag + pointer back at `docs/operating-modes.md` § "Pack emphasis" to the four existing `PACK.md` files: `packs/business-app-kanban/PACK.md`, `packs/code-quality/PACK.md`, `packs/devtool-kanban/PACK.md`, `packs/game-kanban/PACK.md`. Packs without a pack-level doc (`business-app`, `devtool`, `game`, `poketowork-kanban`) were deliberately not given new files — creating pack-level docs was out of scope per plan.
- Contract untouched: no edits to `specs/approved-plan.schema.json`, `scripts/agent-mode.sh`, `scripts/approved-plan.sh`, or any `SKILL.md` workflow. Step 8's `## Degraded-path audit` section remains byte-identical — only the closing status line changed to mention Step 9.
- Verification: `ls global/claude global/codex | sort -u` → 34 unique skill names, matching 34 rows in the Global skills table; 8 pack directories match 8 rows in the Packs table; `grep -oE '(Claude-orchestration|Codex-execution|Both)'` on the new section returns only those three role values (no free-form strings).
- Checked off Step 9 in `tasks/todo.md`, appended a Step 9 Summary, and rolled the Active Step Plan to Step 10 (pack-aware `$run` routing on Codex — sketch). Step 9's prior Active Step Plan is archived in place for reference.

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 11 Step 8 — Degraded-path audit

- Appended `## Degraded-path audit` to `docs/operating-modes.md` with a 19-row Markdown table covering every cross-tool touchpoint that ships today: `global/claude/delegate/SKILL.md` (3 rows — hybrid-only requirement, `codex` binary on PATH, ambiguous transport outcome), `global/claude/handoff/SKILL.md` (2 rows — `--target=codex` mode rejection + `jq` pretty-print dependency), `global/codex/run/SKILL.md --execute-approved` (2 rows — non-`claude-only` constraint + `jq` write path), and the 12 Step-7 planning/execution skills' unset-mode recommendation branches. Every row names one of `claude-only`/`codex-only`/`hybrid`/`any` in **Assumes** and cites a specific SKILL.md section in **Degraded path** — no empty cells.
- Surfaced two concrete gaps under `### Gaps surfaced by Step 8`: (a) `handoff --target=codex` uses `jq` at step 5.5 for pretty-print but ships no degraded path when `jq` is absent; (b) `codex/run --execute-approved` declares `jq` as a hard dependency in § "Constraints" but documents no user-facing failure path. Both are logged for a follow-up step — Step 8 did not fix them, per plan.
- Pack wrappers are explicitly out-of-audit in a trailing paragraph: exploration confirmed they contain no cross-CLI branching, only intra-pack syntax (`$skill` vs `/skill`) routed by the pack loader. Pack emphasis by CLI role lands in Step 9.
- Contract untouched: no edits to `specs/approved-plan.schema.json`, `scripts/agent-mode.sh`, `scripts/approved-plan.sh`, or any `SKILL.md` workflow. Documentation-only step, per plan.
- Verification: `grep -c "^| \`global/" docs/operating-modes.md` = 19 (≥14 required); `grep "| *|$"` returned zero empty cells; three rows spot-checked against source (`delegate` § "Mode requirement" line 17; `handoff` § "Process" step 5.1 line 40; `codex/run` § "Process" step 6c line 37).
- Checked off Step 8 in `tasks/todo.md`, appended a Step 8 Summary, and rolled the Active Step Plan to Step 9 (pack emphasis split by CLI role — sketch).

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 11 Step 7 — Mode-aware terminal recommendations

- Added a shared **Mode-aware next-step recommendation** section to the six Claude planning/execution skills (`plan-interview`, `roadmap`, `plan-phase`, `run`, `ship`, `ship-end`) and the six Codex equivalents (`plan-interview`, `roadmap`, `plan-phase`, `run`, `ship`, `ship-end`). Each block resolves the effective agent mode via `./scripts/agent-mode.sh` and emits exactly one recommendation line matching the resolved mode, with a distinctive phrase ("resolved agent mode via scripts/agent-mode.sh") that makes the block grep-auditable.
- Claude-side branches: `hybrid` → delegate with `/delegate <target>` (Claude orchestrates, Codex executes); `claude-only` → run the Claude skill directly; `codex-only` → run the Codex `$skill` equivalent; unset → present all three options and point at `docs/operating-modes.md` for mode-signal resolution rules. Targets vary per skill context (`/roadmap` after plan-interview, `/plan-phase`/`/run` after roadmap, `/delegate $run` after plan-phase, `/delegate $ship` after `/run`, `/delegate $run` after `/ship` and `/ship-end`).
- Codex-side inversion for `hybrid`: recommendation says "return to Claude for the next orchestration step" rather than "delegate further" — because in hybrid Claude is the orchestrator and Codex only executes. `codex-only` stays in Codex; `claude-only` tells the user to switch to Claude.
- No-recurse invariant preserved: `global/claude/delegate/SKILL.md` and `global/claude/handoff/SKILL.md` do NOT carry the block (they are themselves the mechanisms). Grep of the distinctive phrase across `global/**/SKILL.md` returns exactly 12 files — the expected Claude+Codex targeted set.
- Contract untouched: no edits to `docs/operating-modes.md`, `specs/approved-plan.schema.json`, or `scripts/agent-mode.sh`. Pure consumer of the mode resolver; no new lifecycle states, env vars, or precedence rules.
- Checked off Step 7 in `tasks/todo.md` and rolled the Active Step Plan to Step 8 (degraded-path audit in `docs/operating-modes.md`).

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 11 Step 6 — `/delegate` (Claude)

- Extended `scripts/approved-plan.sh` with `mark-uncertain`: atomic `approved → uncertain` transition (`<file>.tmp` + `mv`, same pattern as `mark-stale`). Rejects `draft`, `consumed`, `stale`, `superseded`, and `uncertain` as source states with a single-line reason + non-zero exit. Usage help + top-level dispatch case updated. `uncertain` was already in the schema enum from Step 3; Step 6 is the first legitimate writer — no schema or FSM edits.
- Shipped `global/claude/delegate/SKILL.md`: a hybrid-only Claude skill that produces an approved packet via the Step 5 producer path (`draft` + one-question approval + `approve`), then invokes Codex synchronously via `codex exec "<target-skill> --execute-approved"` with a start-marker timestamp captured before the call. Argument-hint `"[target-skill] [--allow-dirty <glob>] [--inline-fallback]"`; target skill defaults to `$run`. Derives `phase`/`step`/`title` from the first unchecked `- [ ]` under `### Active Step Plan` (fallback: current `## Phase N` header) using the same parsing rules as `/handoff --target=codex`.
- Three-branch safe-fallback matrix wired end-to-end, **never blind-retries cross-CLI**:
  - **Pre-start failure** (no `codex` binary, auth failure, start marker never printed) → packet stays at `approved`; prompt offers inline-in-Claude vs keep-for-later manual `$run --execute-approved`. `--inline-fallback` auto-selects inline. `agent-team` profile requires explicit confirmation for the inline downgrade.
  - **Success** (exit 0 + `Approved packet consumed: …` log + `tasks/approved-plan.md` shows `lifecycle: consumed`) → report success; Step 4's `consume` already flipped the lifecycle.
  - **Ambiguous** (non-zero exit or timeout after the start marker printed) → call `mark-uncertain`, then prompt inspect / discard (`supersede`) / continue-inline. Never retries the same packet.
- Mode gating: `claude-only` and `codex-only` exit non-zero with `mode-mismatch:` before any packet operation. Only `hybrid` proceeds — `claude-only` has no executor and `codex-only` plans in Codex directly.
- Contract untouched: no edits to `docs/operating-modes.md` or `specs/approved-plan.schema.json`. Codex side remains consumer-only. Step 6 is pure transport + failure-mode wiring on top of Steps 3–5.
- Verified `mark-uncertain` via fixture packets in `/tmp/apktest6/`: happy path (`approved → uncertain`, atomic, no `.tmp` leftovers); `draft` and `uncertain` source states both rejected non-zero with clear reasons (same rejection logic applies uniformly to `consumed`, `stale`, `superseded`).
- Checked off Step 6 in `tasks/todo.md`, appended a Step 6 Summary, and rolled the Active Step Plan to Step 7 (mode-aware terminal recommendations — sketch).

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 11 Step 5 — `/handoff --target=codex` (Claude)

- Extended `scripts/approved-plan.sh` with producer-side subcommands: `draft`, `approve`, `supersede`, `status`. Reused the existing `die` / `fail` / `require_jq_write` / `todo_hash_of` helpers and the `<file>.tmp` + `mv` atomic-write pattern so the consumer and producer share one FSM implementation. `draft` refuses to overwrite a live `approved` packet (explicit `supersede` required); `approve` is the atomic `draft → approved` transition and re-verifies `git_head` + `todo_hash` still match the draft's snapshot, failing loudly on drift. `approve` refreshes `approved_at` to "now" so TTL starts counting at approval, not drafting. `supersede` is `* → superseded` for any non-terminal prior packet. `status` prints a one-line lifecycle summary for preflight use. Producer never runs the six consumer freshness checks — that surface stays in `check`.
- Wired the `--target=codex` branch into `global/claude/handoff/SKILL.md` as step 5 (before the handoff-doc write): mode-resolve via `scripts/agent-mode.sh` and abort on `codex-only`; require a clean tree OR matching `--allow-dirty <glob>` flags (same shell-glob semantics as `check`); derive `phase` / `step` / `title` from the first unchecked `- [ ]` under `### Active Step Plan`, falling back to the current `## Phase N` section; call `approved-plan.sh draft …`; pretty-print the packet and ask one concise approval question before calling `approve`; add a "Cross-CLI handoff" section to `tasks/handoff.md` naming the packet file, the committable mirror, and the Codex resume command `$run --execute-approved`. Updated `argument-hint` to `"[focus area] [--target=codex]"`. Default (no `--target`) flow untouched.
- Verified with `/tmp/apktest5` fixtures: `draft` happy path yields `lifecycle=draft` with correct `git_head`, `todo_hash`, fresh `approved_at`, and `blocking_manual_tasks=[]`; dirty tree with matching `--allow-dirty` succeeds, without matching fails with a clear reason; `draft` refuses to clobber an `approved` packet and succeeds after `supersede`; `approve` happy path flips to `approved` and refreshes the timestamp; editing `tasks/todo.md` between `draft` and `approve` trips the drift guard; full round-trip `draft → approve → check → consume` leaves the `.md` mirror at `lifecycle: consumed`; every lifecycle snapshot validates against `specs/approved-plan.schema.json` via `jsonschema` in a venv.
- Contract untouched: no edits to `docs/operating-modes.md` or `specs/approved-plan.schema.json`. Step 5 only adds the producer side; the consumer (Step 4) and the schema (Step 3) remain frozen.
- Checked off Step 5 in `tasks/todo.md`, appended a Step 5 Summary, and rolled the Active Step Plan sketch to Step 6 (`/delegate`).

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 11 Step 4 — `$run --execute-approved` (Codex)

- Added `scripts/approved-plan.sh` (Bash 3.2, style-matched to `scripts/agent-mode.sh`) with `check`, `consume`, `mark-stale` subcommands. `check` runs the six freshness checks from the Step 3 contract in cheapest-first order (lifecycle → TTL → git HEAD → `todo_hash` → dirty-path scan → manual-todo scan); each failure emits a single-line reason. `consume` transitions `approved → consumed` atomically (`<file>.tmp` + `mv`) and writes the sanitized `tasks/approved-plan.md` mirror projecting only `.md`-safe fields (omits `allowed_dirty_paths`, `notes`). `mark-stale` does the same atomic move to `stale`. Hidden `--packet <path>` override on every subcommand for fixture tests.
- Wired the `--execute-approved` branch into `global/codex/run/SKILL.md` as step 6c: on `check=ok` it runs `consume`, logs `Approved packet consumed: …`, and skips directly to the execute step, bypassing the plan-present + approval gate; on failure it relays the reason, runs `mark-stale`, and falls through to the normal approval flow (never auto-retry). `--execute-approved --phase` is rejected. Flag documented in the header `argument-hint` and a new Constraints bullet. Mode-mismatch guard: `claude-only` makes the flag a user error; helper exits non-zero with `mode-mismatch:` before touching the packet.
- Verified with `/tmp/apktest/` fixtures: happy path returns `ok` exit 0; each failure mode (lifecycle=draft, expired TTL, mismatched git_head, mismatched todo_hash, unexpected dirty path, mode-mismatch) prints its specific reason and exits non-zero; `consume` flips lifecycle and writes the mirror; re-`consume` on an already-consumed packet is idempotent; pre- and post-consume packets both validate against `specs/approved-plan.schema.json` via `jsonschema` in a venv.
- Contract untouched — no edits to `docs/operating-modes.md` or `specs/approved-plan.schema.json`, matching the Step 3 intent that the schema stay frozen for the first consumer.
- Checked off Step 4 in `tasks/todo.md`, appended a Step 4 Summary, rolled the Active Step Plan to Step 5 (sketch).

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 11 Step 3 — Shared approval/delegation packet contract

- Expanded `docs/operating-modes.md` § "Approval / Delegation Packet" (now 108 lines, kept in place — no extraction needed) with the full field schema, the `draft → approved → (consumed | stale | superseded | uncertain)` lifecycle state machine, the `.md`-safe vs JSON-only safety classification, and the six freshness checks (named here, implementation owned by Step 4).
- Defined `todo_hash` normalization once and for all: strip UTF-8 BOM, normalize CRLF → LF, sha256 the bytes.
- Shipped `specs/approved-plan.schema.json` (draft-07). Validated a well-formed example via `jsonschema` in a venv; confirmed it rejects bad-lifecycle (`frozen`) and missing-`git_head` packets.
- Seeded `tasks/approved-plan.md` with an empty-state notice ("no packet currently approved") and a worked example of the sanitized mirror format. Only projects `.md`-safe fields.
- Added `.agents/approved-plan.json` to `.gitignore` (path-prefixed). `git check-ignore .agents/approved-plan.json` returns the path, exit 0.
- No executable code introduced — deliberately contract-only to prevent schema/consumer drift. Step 4 (`$run --execute-approved`) is the first legitimate consumer; grep confirms no SKILL.md or script references the packet yet.
- Checked off Step 3 in `tasks/todo.md`; rolled the Active Step Plan block to Step 4 (sketch only — detailed plan will land when Step 4 starts).

## 2026-04-19 — Clarify Claude run/ship boundaries from session history

- Parsed recent Claude history/transcripts for `/run`, `/ship`, commits, pushes, and plan-mode entries.
- Found `/run` push behavior only in older sessions (2026-03-26, 2026-03-31, 2026-04-02); since 2026-04-10, `/run` entered plan mode but did not push. The remaining risk was an instruction conflict between `/run` and the default shipping contract.
- Follow-up analysis found the main no-op `/ship` source: accepted `/ship` plans launch as plain "Implement the following plan" sessions. Since 2026-04-10, 219 of 236 such sessions committed and 218 pushed before the next `/ship`.
- Updated Claude `/run` to be explicitly execution-only: no `/commit-and-push-by-feature`, no `git commit`, no `git push`; successful runs hand off to `/ship`.
- Updated Claude `/ship` so no explicit deploy contract means deploy skipped, writing/finding a next-step plan is not complete until EnterPlanMode succeeds, and the clear-context implementation plan explicitly uses a ship-one-step handoff: implement the approved step, validate, commit/push, deploy only with an explicit manual deploy contract, write the following plan, enter plan mode, and stop before implementation.

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 11 Step 1 — thin `docs/operating-modes.md`

- Added `docs/operating-modes.md` naming the three-mode (`claude-only`, `codex-only`, `hybrid`) operating model with a per-mode paragraph, a forward-reference to the mode signal and approval packet, and an explicit "expansions coming in later steps" framing.
- Checked off Phase 11 Step 1 in `tasks/todo.md` and wrote the self-contained plan for Step 2 (mode resolution: `.agents/project.json.agent_mode`, `SKILLS_AGENT_MODE`, `scripts/agent-mode.sh`).
- No skill, schema, or code behavior changed yet; Step 2 wires the signal without consumers.

## 2026-04-17 — Add execution profiles and guard Claude plan-mode exits

- Added strategic `Parallelization` and `Coordination Notes` fields to roadmap generation for Claude and Codex skills
- Added `### Execution Profile` planning guidance to `plan-phase`, including serial, research-only, review-only, implementation-safe, and agent-team modes with subagent lane ownership rules
- Updated `run` and `ship` skills to preserve and apply the current phase execution profile while keeping task docs, history, shipping, and deploy ownership with the main agent
- Guarded Claude `ExitPlanMode` usage in `run`, `scaffold`, `migrate`, and `decommission` so an already-normal post-approval session continues instead of failing with "You are not in plan mode"
- Deploy skipped: no explicit manual deploy contract (`deploy.md` or `tasks/deploy.md`)

## 2026-04-17 — Unify plan-interview → roadmap → plan-phase flow

- Renamed `plan-phases` → `plan-phase` (singular) across Claude and Codex global skill trees, including the Codex `agents/openai.yaml` side-file
- Dropped Mode B from the skill: `plan-phase` now requires `tasks/roadmap.md` and only decomposes one phase per invocation, preserving Goal/Scope/Acceptance Criteria from the roadmap
- `/roadmap` State B now auto-invokes `/plan-phase 1` (section 4d) so users land on an actionable `tasks/todo.md` after roadmap creation instead of an undecomposed plan
- `/plan-interview` now tells the user to run `/roadmap` next rather than leaving the handoff ambiguous
- Updated all callers (`ship`, `run`, `reconcile-dev-docs`, `skills`) and docs (`README.md`, `docs/skills-reference.md`, `docs/codex-workflow.md`) to reference `plan-phase`
- Refreshed symlinks via `./install.sh`; stale `plan-phases` links removed, new `plan-phase` links in both `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.codex/skills`
- Deploy skipped: no manual deploy contract for this repo

## 2026-04-17 — Require live AWS auth check before SSO login

- Tightened Codex and Claude deploy/ship instructions so agents must not run `aws sso login` from stale context, old logs, or assumptions
- Required `aws sts get-caller-identity --profile <profile>` when AWS auth status is uncertain, and explicitly skips SSO login when that identity check succeeds
- Preserved the SSO recovery path for actual missing or expired credentials after a live identity check or deploy-command failure
- Added `tasks/lessons.md` entry for checking live AWS auth before prompting for SSO login
- Validation: `git diff --check`, `scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `scripts/detect-secrets.sh`
- Deploy skipped: no explicit manual deploy contract (`deploy.md` or `tasks/deploy.md`)

## 2026-04-16 — Clarify skill invocation and AWS SSO deploy recovery

- Added explicit `Invoke as $...` guidance across Codex global and pack skill docs so each skill documents its Codex invocation form
- Updated Codex and Claude deploy/ship workflows so expired or missing AWS SSO credentials trigger `aws sso login --profile <profile>` and user browser-login instructions instead of a skipped deploy
- Defined failed SSO completion as an authentication blocker, not a skipped deploy, and reruns the original deploy command once after successful login
- Validation: `git diff --check`, `scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `scripts/detect-secrets.sh`, and `scripts/pack.sh list`
- Deploy skipped: no explicit manual deploy contract (`deploy.md` or `tasks/deploy.md`)

## 2026-04-16 — Add code-quality cleanup orchestrator

- Added mirrored Claude and Codex `quality-sweep` skills to the `code-quality` pack
- Defined audit-only default behavior plus explicit `fix` and `full` modes for behavior-preserving cleanup campaigns
- Documented the eight audit lanes: duplication, shared types, unused code, circular dependencies, weak types, error handling, legacy paths, and comments/stubs
- Added Codex agent metadata and updated the Code Quality Pack docs/reference flow to include `quality-sweep audit -> extract-shared-types / quality-sweep fix -> regression-check`
- Validation: YAML/frontmatter parsing for new skill files, `scripts/pack.sh list`, Claude/Codex skill mirror diff, and `git diff --check`
- Deploy skipped: no explicit manual deploy contract (`deploy.md` or `tasks/deploy.md`)

## 2026-04-15 — Clarify pack skill reload behavior

- Updated `scripts/pack.sh` so `install`, `remove`, and `refresh` print a fresh-session notice after changing project-local skill links
- Documented that pack `refresh` recreates `.claude/skills` and `.codex/skills` symlinks but does not reload an already-running Claude Code or Codex process
- Bumped `/pack` and `$pack` skill versions to 1.1.1
- Added regression coverage for install/remove/refresh fresh-session notices
- Validation: `npm test -- pack.test.mjs`, `scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, and `git diff --check`
- Deploy skipped: no explicit manual deploy contract (`deploy.md` or `tasks/deploy.md`)

## 2026-04-15 — Rename workflow to research-roadmap

- Renamed the global Claude and Codex `workflow` skill directories to `research-roadmap`
- Updated the skill metadata, title, Codex agent manifest, roadmap handoff, skills grouping, README, packs docs, and business-app research recommendations to use `/research-roadmap` or `$research-roadmap`
- Reframed the skill as the research/documentation counterpart to `roadmap`, while leaving the future workflow-orchestrator idea available as a distinct follow-up
- Queued `$research-roadmap` as the next task after the completed roadmap
- Validation: active-reference search for old `/workflow`, `$workflow`, and `name: workflow`

## 2026-04-14 — Require archive-first research/spec doc replacements

- Added a shared Archive-First Replacement Policy to 92 Claude/Codex skill docs that write or wrap canonical research/spec documentation
- Updated `$spec-drift` so code-right resolutions archive the existing spec before updating the canonical spec
- Updated `$reconcile-research` so fix-mode research resolutions archive existing documents before applying approved canonical changes
- Updated `$reconcile-dev-docs` so spec and `docs/specifications/` replacements archive first while task/history append behavior remains unchanged
- Extended the policy to kanban plan-interview wrappers so spec-writing entrypoints preserve prior versions before replacement
- Validation: `git diff --check`
- Deploy skipped: no explicit manual deploy contract (`deploy.md` or `tasks/deploy.md`)

## 2026-04-13 — Add code-quality pack and documentation-first workflow

- Added guided no-argument setup to `/pack` and `$pack`, with committed project-designation refresh when `.agents/project.json` exists and recommendation/confirmation flow when it is missing
- Extended `scripts/pack.sh` with multi-pack install/remove, pack-name aliases, lock protection, portable pack listing, and skill-local launcher scripts under both pack skill mirrors
- Added the project-local `code-quality` pack with mirrored `extract-shared-types` skills and Codex agent metadata
- Updated README and pack docs for `code-quality`, guided setup, and committed `.agents/project.json` expectations
- Refactored `/workflow` and `$workflow` from read-only `--catchup` status reporters into documentation front-loaders that maintain `## Priority Documentation Todo` in `tasks/todo.md`

## 2026-04-12 — Clarify reconciliation skill names

- Renamed `/research-reconcile` to `/reconcile-research` across Claude and Codex skill directories and active references
- Added `/reconcile-dev-docs` for auditing or fixing drift across `tasks/roadmap.md`, `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/history.md`, phase archives, specs, git history, and code reality
- Added Codex `agents/openai.yaml` manifests for `/reconcile-research` and `/reconcile-dev-docs`
- Updated README, skills reference, and `/skills` stage mapping to distinguish research reconciliation from development-doc reconciliation

## 2026-04-11 — Extend ICP skills with business model, champions, funnel, and expansion

- Extended `/icp` (v3.4.0 → v3.5.0) with business model classification, new section 10 (`## Acquisition & Conversion Model`) covering funnel shape, motion type & cycle length, DMU, champion & advocate dynamics, expansion & retention dynamics, and budget & procurement. Canonical 9-section structure preserved for downstream compatibility.
- Extended `/enterprise-icp` (v2.1.0/v2.2.0 → v2.3.0) with four new interview areas: champion enablement & risk, budget cycle & procurement, land-and-expand strategy, and enterprise segmentation. Output sections grew from 7 to 11. Lifecycle gained an Expansion stage.
- Updated both Claude and Codex mirrors for each skill (4 files total)
- Ran `install.sh` to update symlinks

## 2026-04-08 — Tighten research skills to assume no insider knowledge

- Updated 11 Codex skill prompts so research-oriented workflows default to deep, self-sufficient analysis instead of asking whether findings match the user's intuition
- Added explicit "default stance" guidance in core research skills (`competitive-analysis`, `icp`, `positioning`, `burn-rate`) to explain terms from first principles and ask for constraints or factual corrections only when needed
- Reworded validation checkpoints across GTM, metrics, monetization, journey-map, enterprise-icp, cohort-review, and plan-interview to request missing facts, weak assumptions, or product constraints rather than insider confirmation
- Verified with ripgrep that the edited Codex skill set no longer contains the prior "match your intuition" / "does this feel right" checkpoint language
- No deploy step — repo has no explicit manual deploy contract (`deploy.md` or `tasks/deploy.md`)

## 2026-04-07 — Fix skill frontmatter YAML parsing

- Normalized `argument-hint` frontmatter across 55 Claude/Codex skill files from unquoted bracket syntax to quoted YAML scalars
- Fixed the immediate loader failure in `codex/landing-copy/SKILL.md` and proactively cleaned the same pattern in related skills
- Verified no remaining `argument-hint: [...]` frontmatter values via ripgrep
- Parsed representative edited frontmatters with Ruby `YAML.safe_load` to confirm the loader-facing syntax is valid

## 2026-04-07 — Phase 10 Step 6: Deprecate standalone kanban DB-write path (complete)

- Updated `claude/poketo-kanban/scripts/kanban.mjs` help output so the default workflow is explicitly `poketo kanban`, with the direct-DB script labeled fallback/admin-only
- Updated `claude/poketo-kanban/scripts/bootstrap-session.mjs` and `claude/poketo-kanban/scripts/setup.sh` so adjacent helper messaging no longer presents `node kanban.mjs ...` as the standard verification path
- Verified active Claude and Codex skill/docs paths still contain no standard-use dependency on `POKETOWORK_DATABASE_URL` or `~/.claude/skills/poketo-kanban/scripts/kanban.mjs`
- Archived the completed final phase to `tasks/phases/phase-10.md`, marked Phase 10 complete in `tasks/roadmap.md`, and converted `tasks/todo.md` into a roadmap-complete status file
- Targeted validation: `npx vitest run bootstrap-session.test.mjs install.test.mjs` and `node kanban.mjs --help`

## 2026-04-06 — Phase 10 Step 5: Migrate Codex kanban skills to poketo CLI (complete)

- Updated `codex/poketo-kanban/SKILL.md` — standard usage now runs through `poketo kanban`, version bumped to 1.1.0, and `POKETOWORK_DATABASE_URL` was removed from the default prerequisites
- Updated `codex/sync-roadmap-kanban/SKILL.md` — board resolution and active kanban mutations now use `poketo kanban`, with `allowed-tools` documenting `Bash(poketo *), Bash(git *)`
- Updated 6 Codex consumer skills (`run`, `ship`, `ship-end`, `brainstorm`, `roadmap`, `plan-interview`) — kanban setup now uses `poketo kanban` and no longer references `~/.claude/skills/.../kanban.mjs`
- Verified: no remaining `POKETOWORK_DATABASE_URL` or `~/.claude/skills/poketo-kanban/scripts/kanban.mjs` references in active Codex skill files
- Advanced `tasks/todo.md` to Phase 10 Step 6 with a focused deprecation plan for the remaining fallback-only `kanban.mjs` path

## 2026-04-06 — Phase 10 Step 4: Migrate Claude kanban skills to poketo CLI (complete)

- Added `--description` flag to `poketo kanban create-card` and `--template standard` flag to `poketo kanban create-board` in poke CLI (`packages/cli/src/commands/kanban.ts`)
- Updated `claude/poketo-kanban/SKILL.md` — all commands now use `poketo kanban`, prerequisites updated (no more `POKETOWORK_DATABASE_URL`), version bumped to 1.1.0
- Updated `claude/poketo-kanban/KANBAN-SETUP.md` — board resolution and graceful degradation now check for `poketo` CLI on PATH
- Updated `claude/sync-roadmap-kanban/SKILL.md` — all 4 `kanban.mjs` invocations replaced with `poketo kanban`, version bumped to 1.1.0
- Updated 6 consumer skills (`run`, `ship`, `ship-end`, `brainstorm`, `roadmap`, `plan-interview`) — `allowed-tools: Bash(node *)` → `Bash(poketo *)`
- Added deprecation header to `claude/poketo-kanban/scripts/kanban.mjs`
- Verified: no remaining `kanban.mjs` references in any Claude skill file, no remaining `Bash(node *)` in allowed-tools
- CLI compiles and builds cleanly with the new flags

## 2026-04-06 — Rename repo to agentic-skills and refresh installed skills

- Renamed the local checkout from `/Users/georgele/projects/tools/claude-skills` to `/Users/georgele/projects/tools/agentic-skills`
- Renamed the GitHub repo from `GeorgeQLe/claude-skills` to `GeorgeQLe/agentic-skills` and updated `origin`
- Re-ran `bash install.sh` to refresh global Claude and Codex skill symlinks for the new repo path
- Removed 24 stale legacy symlinks that still pointed at deleted `claude-skills` skill paths after the installer run
- Updated `tasks/todo.md` references so the active Phase 10 plan points at `agentic-skills`

## 2026-04-04 — Add /platform-strategy skill

- Created `claude/platform-strategy/SKILL.md` v1.0.0 — research-driven multi-product expansion planning skill
- Covers: core product health assessment, vertical/horizontal expansion vector mapping, 5-dimension scoring matrix, lightweight validation experiment design, portfolio sequencing (Now/Next/Later/Watch), shared platform considerations
- Prerequisites: `research/icp.md` or working codebase; enriched by competitive-analysis, journey-map, metrics, monetization, positioning, customer-feedback, enterprise-icp
- Output: `research/platform-strategy.md` + `research/platform-strategy-search-log.md`
- Created `codex/platform-strategy/SKILL.md` v1.0.0 — condensed Codex variant
- Updated `docs/skills-reference.md` with the new skill and platform-expansion workflow note
- No deploy step — repo is a tools directory

## 2026-04-04 — Add comprehensive README

- Created `README.md` documenting the full skill library for both Claude Code and Codex
- Covers: installation, repository structure, platform differences (Claude Code vs Codex), workflow overview with ASCII pipeline diagram, 6 named workflow flows, all 60 skills organized into 12 categories with descriptions/arguments/outputs, activity types taxonomy, kanban integration architecture, file contracts, skill dependency chains, and versioning scheme
- No deploy step — repo is a tools directory, not a production product

## 2026-04-06 — Phase 10 Step 2: Wire Poketo Work headless tool layer

- Created 3 new primitive tools in Poketo monorepo: `create-board.ts`, `search-cards.ts`, `restore-card.ts`
- Fixed `delete-card.ts` description from "permanently" to archive semantics
- Extended `adapted-tools.ts` with 4 new adapt functions (getMyBoards, createBoard, searchCards, restoreCard) — 15 total adapted tools
- Removed `getMyBoardsTool` from `tools/index.ts` barrel (now in adapted pipeline only)
- Updated all 3 test files for new tool counts and mock callers — 116 tests pass
- Advanced `tasks/todo.md` to Phase 10 Step 3

## 2026-04-06 — Skills audit: consolidate kanban variants into base skills

- Merged 7 `-kanban` variant skills into their base skills with a `--kanban` flag: plan-interview, roadmap, ship, ship-end, run, brainstorm, poketo-kanban
- Merged `plan-interview-ideas` into `plan-interview` with `--ideas` flag
- Merged `kanban-archive` into `poketo-kanban` with `--archive` flag
- Removed 16 variant directories (8 from claude/, 8 from codex/)
- Updated cross-references in skills/SKILL.md, docs/codex-workflow.md, docs/skills-reference.md, docs/kanban-test-results.md
- Result: 52 claude skills (was 60), 49 codex skills (was 57)

## 2026-04-03 — Headless auth migration brief for Phase 10

- Audited the current Claude and Codex kanban assumptions around `POKETOWORK_DATABASE_URL`, `~/.poketo/config.json`, and Codex's hardcoded `~/.claude/skills/.../kanban.mjs` path
- Wrote `/Users/georgele/projects/tools/claude-skills/specs/poketo-headless-auth-migration.md` to define the recommended target auth path: scoped `pk_...` API keys through the agent gateway, with the standalone DB script retained only as transitional fallback
- Captured the canonical Poketo monorepo files for the intended headless path: gateway auth, session-backed agent caller, Work adapter, and board/card/list tRPC routers
- Documented the current migration blockers in the Work tool layer: `get-my-boards` stubbed, primitive tools still placeholders, and missing board discovery/create-board/search/archive-restore coverage
- Advanced `tasks/todo.md` to Phase 10 Step 2 and replaced the next-step implementation plan with a concrete Work tool wiring plan

## 2026-04-03 — Refactor Codex workflow so run ships by default

- Updated `codex/run` and `codex/run-kanban` to make the Codex execution loop explicit: plan, approve, implement, validate, commit/push, optional deploy, and next-step preparation all happen inside `run`
- Repositioned `codex/ship` and `codex/ship-kanban` as compatibility/manual cleanup workflows for already-finished work instead of the default next step after `run`
- Updated Codex-facing docs and metadata (`docs/codex-workflow.md`, `docs/skills-reference.md`, run/ship agent prompts, `codex/workflow`) to describe the new execute-and-ship-by-default model
- Pre-ship validation: `npm test` in `claude/poketo-kanban/scripts` still fails with pre-existing kanban regressions and Neon connectivity errors; not fixed in this shipping step

## 2026-04-02 — Make Codex ship deploy opt-in via explicit contract

- Updated `codex/ship`, `codex/ship-kanban`, `codex/ship-end`, and `codex/ship-end-kanban` so manual deploy only runs when `deploy.md` or `tasks/deploy.md` exists; added `--no-deploy` support across the Codex ship family
- Updated Codex ship agent metadata and `docs/skills-reference.md` to describe the deploy-contract behavior and new ship-end arguments
- Fixed YAML frontmatter quoting in the edited Codex ship-family skill files so skill loading works again
- Transitioned `tasks/todo.md` from a completed snapshot to Phase 10: Headless API Migration, with a concrete Step 1 plan for establishing agent-friendly headless auth
- Pre-ship validation: `npm test` in `claude/poketo-kanban/scripts` failed with pre-existing kanban regressions and Neon connectivity errors; not fixed in this shipping step

## 2026-04-02 — Normalize Codex skill references to `$skill`

- Updated Codex-facing docs to use native `$skill` invocation syntax in [docs/codex-workflow.md] and clarified dual syntax guidance in [docs/skills-reference.md]
- Updated Codex skill docs so next-step recommendations, prerequisite guidance, and example output use `$skill` instead of Claude-style `/skill`
- Updated `scripts/skill-deps.sh` to scan both `claude/` and `codex/` skills and recognize both `/skill-name` and `$skill-name` references
- Verified no remaining slash-prefixed skill references across `codex/*/SKILL.md`
- No deploy step for this repository; repo treated as a tools directory rather than a production product

## 2026-04-02 — Enhance skill follow-through and close dead-end workflows

- Enhanced `mvp-gap` (v1.1.0→v1.2.0): added downstream impact check (scans journey-map, metrics, gtm, monetization, roadmap for conflicts), spec validation (checks existing specs before suggesting /plan-interview), journey stage mapping per gap, metrics tie-in (closure metrics + instrumentation gap flagging), GTM alignment (cross-references build sequence against launch gates), enriched output format with _Journey stage:_, _Closure metric:_, _Spec:_ per gap
- Enhanced `dead-code` (v1.0.0→v1.1.0): added Follow-Through section — writes "Safe to Remove" items as checkboxes to `tasks/todo.md` under `## Dead Code Cleanup`, suggests `/run` to execute
- Enhanced `expert-review` (v1.0.0→v1.1.0): added Follow-Through section — writes Critical/High findings as checkboxes to `tasks/todo.md` under `## Code Review Fixes`, suggests `/run` or `/investigate`
- Enhanced `regression-check` (v1.0.0→v1.1.0): added Follow-Through section — writes new failures (not pre-existing) as checkboxes to `tasks/todo.md` under `## Regression Fixes`, only when verdict is "Issues found"
- Synced all changes to codex/ variants (mvp-gap, dead-code, expert-review, regression-check)

## 2026-04-01 — Update /deploy skill with deployment history tracking

- Updated `claude/deploy/SKILL.md` v1.0.0→v2.0.0 — added deployment ledger (`tasks/deploys.md`), pre-deploy diff, staleness detection, `--status` flag
- New step 4: compare against last deployment — shows commits about to ship and time since last deploy
- New step 7: record each deploy (success/failed) to ledger with UTC timestamp, branch, commit range, commit count
- New step 8: staleness report across all tracked environments — flags 7+ days old or 20+ commits behind
- Failed deploys recorded but don't reset staleness clock
- Added Ledger Format section documenting `tasks/deploys.md` structure
- Updated `codex/deploy/SKILL.md` and `docs/skills-reference.md` to match

## 2026-04-01 — Add /slim-audit skill

- Created `claude/slim-audit/SKILL.md` — analysis skill to audit codebases for LOC reduction opportunities
- 6 audit categories: duplication, over-abstraction, verbose patterns, redundant logic, hand-rolled replacements, structural bloat
- Preserves functionality as top priority — behavior changes get separate risk classification
- Cross-references specs/docs to respect intentional design decisions; false-positive filter on all findings
- Created `codex/slim-audit/SKILL.md` and `codex/slim-audit/agents/openai.yaml`
- Updated `docs/skills-reference.md`: Code Quality section entry, activity types, quick reference, count 54→55

## 2026-04-01 — Add /spec-drift skill + workflow integration

- Created `claude/spec-drift/SKILL.md` — new analysis skill that extracts verifiable claims from specs and checks them against the codebase
- Supports audit (read-only) and fix (interactive resolution) modes with monorepo support
- 8 claim types: routes, data models, feature behaviors, config/env, UI flows, CLI, pricing/limits, integration points
- Claims classified as Verified/Diverged/Unimplemented/Removed; also detects undocumented code
- Fix mode includes downstream impact check (journey-map, metrics, roadmap)
- Updated `claude/workflow/SKILL.md`: added git-log-vs-spec staleness rule + dependency graph entry
- Updated `docs/skills-reference.md`: added entry in Evaluate section, Quick Reference table, activity types, skill count 52→53

## 2026-04-01 — Add downstream impact check to 6 research skills

- Added post-write "Downstream Impact Check" step to icp, competitive-analysis, journey-map, metrics, gtm, and customer-feedback skills
- Each skill now scans its downstream dependents for conflicts after writing, classifies impact (None/Minor/Major), and recommends `/research-reconcile` for Major
- Added `## Downstream Impact` section to each skill's output template (before `## Next Steps`)
- Added impact-aware Next Steps logic (Major prepends reconcile, Minor annotates stale items)
- Leaf nodes (monetization, enterprise-icp) left unmodified — nothing reads their output downstream
- Version bumps: icp 3.3.0→3.4.0, competitive-analysis 2.2.0→2.3.0, journey-map/metrics/gtm/customer-feedback 1.1.0→1.2.0

## 2026-03-31 — Add `tasks/manual-todo.md` support across 13 skills

- Added manual task classification and `manual-todo.md` output to `plan-phases` (claude + codex)
- Added "Manual tasks" interview topic and `**Manual Tasks:**` phase format to `roadmap` and `roadmap-kanban` (claude + codex)
- Added blocking task check (step 5), manual task reporting, and "Do NOT execute" constraint to `run` and `run-kanban` (claude + codex)
- Added phase transition archival (`phase-N-manual.md`), next-phase extraction, commit inclusion, and status reporting to `ship` and `ship-kanban` (claude + codex)
- Added manual task status checking and output line to `ship-end` and `ship-end-kanban` (claude + codex)
- Added `manual-todo.md` to scan/read lists and output for `workflow`, `handoff`, `sync`, `sync-roadmap-kanban` (claude + codex)
- Resolved pre-existing merge conflict in `claude/research-reconcile/SKILL.md`
- 26 SKILL.md files modified (13 skills × 2 platforms)

## 2026-03-31 — Implement multi-user kanban (all 4 phases)

- Implemented all 4 phases in `kanban.mjs`: updatedAt responses, audit logging, optimistic locking, activity command
- Phase 1: cmdDone/cmdMoveCard/cmdArchiveCard now return full card objects with updatedAt
- Phase 2: Added board_actions schema, logAction helper, agentSessionId; wired into 8 commands
- Phase 3: --expect-updated-at flag with conflict detection on update/move/done/archive
- Phase 4: New `activity` command with --card/--board/--limit flags
- Fixed timestamp precision issue (Postgres NOW() microseconds vs JS Date milliseconds) by using explicit `new Date()` in create-card
- All 92 tests green (22 previously red tests now passing)

## 2026-03-31 — TDD tests for multi-user kanban features

- Added 28 tests across 4 new describe blocks to `kanban.test.mjs` (64→92 total)
- Test DB helper: direct Drizzle/Neon connection to query `board_actions` table for audit log verification
- Card updatedAt block (5 tests): 2 pass (create/update), 3 red (move/done/archive omit updatedAt)
- Audit logging block (10 tests): all red — kanban.mjs doesn't write to board_actions yet
- Optimistic locking block (8 tests): 2 pass (correct timestamp/omitted flag), 6 red (conflict detection not implemented)
- Activity command block (5 tests): 1 pass (missing args error), 4 red (command doesn't exist)
- Created `tasks/todo.md` with 4-phase implementation plan for turning tests green
- All 64 existing tests still pass; 22 new tests in expected TDD red state

## 2026-03-30 — Add --plan flag to /investigate + new /branch-lifecycle skill (51→52)

- Enhanced `/investigate` (v1.0.0→v1.1.0): added `--plan` flag for multi-step fix planning
  - Step 6 split: inline mode (single fix, default) vs plan mode (`--plan` or 3+ discrete steps)
  - New step 7: writes `## Investigation Fix: [title]` with checkable items to `tasks/todo.md` (appends, never overwrites)
  - Added "Fix Steps Written" output section (shown instead of "Fix Applied" in plan mode)
  - New constraints: no `docs/debug-changelog.md` writes, no todo.md for single-step fixes unless `--plan` explicit
- Created `/branch-lifecycle` skill (v1.0.0) with 5 actions: list, pr, review, merge, cleanup
  - `list`: inventory unmerged branches with PR status, age, ahead/behind
  - `pr`: create PRs for branches without one
  - `review`: evaluate PR for correctness, tests, conflicts, scope
  - `merge`: squash merge approved PRs (respects CLAUDE.md overrides)
  - `cleanup`: delete merged branches, prompt for stale ones (never auto-deletes)
- Updated `/skills` stage mapping: added "Git Workflow" stage with `branch-lifecycle`
- Updated `docs/skills-reference.md`: count 51→52, new Git Workflow section, updated `/investigate` entry, quick reference rows
- Symlink installed via `install.sh`

## 2026-03-30 — Strengthen evidence requirements at checkpoint instructions

- Audited all AskUserQuestion checkpoints across 9 research/strategy skills — found 10 of 22 presenting bare conclusions without evidence
- Added evidence-citing requirements to 11 checkpoints across 9 skills (x2 for codex copies = 22 file edits)
- Skills updated: icp (CP1, CP3), competitive-analysis (CP1), gtm (validation), monetization (CP2), journey-map (validation), metrics (validation), enterprise-icp (orient + validation), plan-interview/kanban/ideas (coverage checkpoint), research-reconcile (fix mode)
- Key patterns added: cite pain evidence + search sources (icp), cite ICP behavior data + competitor benchmarks (gtm), cite competitor pricing + willingness-to-pay signals (monetization), cite ICP/competitive/spec evidence (journey-map), structured coverage summary with decisions and reasoning (plan-interview variants), side-by-side conflicting claims with direct quotes (research-reconcile)
- Enterprise-icp orient step now includes WebSearch for enterprise buying patterns before asking user

## 2026-03-30 — Add multi-app monorepo & multi-ICP support to 13 skills

- Added directory-based namespacing: `research/{app}/` and `specs/{app}/` instead of flat files with app suffixes
- Updated /icp: monorepo output changed from `icp-{app}.md` to `{app}/icp.md`, added migration for old convention
- Added Step 0 (App Scope Resolution) to all 13 research/strategy skills — auto-detects monorepo via subdirectories
- Updated /research-reconcile: per-app reconciliation + cross-app checks, scans `research/{app}/` subdirectories
- Updated /workflow: per-app status table, app-specific recommendations
- Zero impact on single-product repos — step 0 only activates when `research/` contains subdirectories
- All changes applied to both claude/ and codex/ (26 files total)
- Version bumps: icp 3.3.0, competitive-analysis 2.2.0, enterprise-icp 2.1.0, all others 1.1.0

## 2026-03-30 — Add "research and recommend" default to interview-driven skills

- Updated 6 interview-driven skills to default to "research and recommend" pattern instead of "pick from options"
- Skills updated: /gtm, /metrics, /journey-map, /enterprise-icp, /monetization (checkpoint 1), /plan-interview
- New default: research first (web search, upstream docs, codebase), present findings with data, state recommendation, user approves/adjusts/overrides
- Only asks user to choose without recommendation when insider knowledge is genuinely required
- Applied to both claude and codex SKILL.md files (12 files total)

## 2026-03-30 — Add concept-validation mode to /competitive-analysis (v2.0.0→v2.1.0)

- Added concept-validation mode: activates when no ICP and no meaningful codebase (or `concept` argument)
- New Step 4a: Gap Assessment with Market State, Incumbent Quality, Gap Quality, Verdict + user checkpoint
- Concept mode frames positioning as hypothetical, always recommends `/icp` as first next step
- Updated `/workflow` skill: added "Concept" phase, concept-validation fork in dependency graph, updated recommendation rules
- Updated `docs/skills-reference.md`: new gap-first flow, updated `/competitive-analysis` entry and quick reference
- Applied to both claude and codex SKILL.md files

## 2026-03-29 — Add /research-reconcile skill + fix phase archive paths (50→51)

- Created `/research-reconcile` skill (claude + codex) — cross-document consistency audit for research outputs
- 5 scope groups (icp, pricing, journey, enterprise, feedback) with 39 pairwise checks + 3 monorepo checks
- Audit mode (read-only, default) and fix mode (user-approved edits + reconciliation-report.md)
- Severity classification: Error (active contradiction), Warning (stale/gap), Info (suggestion)
- Dependency direction informs recommendations; customer feedback treated as ground truth
- Updated docs/skills-reference.md: count 50→51, new entry in Discovery & Market Fit, quick reference row
- Pre-existing fixes also included:
  - Fixed `docs/phases/` → `tasks/phases/` path in ship, ship-kanban, codex/ship (3 files)
  - Added phase archive check to hygiene + codex/hygiene (2 files)
  - Removed stale `docs/skills-reference.md` and `docs/skill-versioning.md` required-doc checks from hygiene

## 2026-03-28 — Enhance /icp skill: monorepo, geography, named accounts (v3.1→v3.2)

- Added monorepo detection to Step 1 — checks for turbo.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml, lerna.json, nx.json, package.json workspaces; produces per-app `research/icp-{app-name}.md` when multiple distinct user-facing products exist
- Added 2 new search strategies (#11 geographic/regulatory, #12 named account searches) to Step 2
- Expanded Customer Profile in Step 4 with two conditional sub-sections: Geographic Focus (regulatory/language/market constraints) and Named Accounts (B2B: 5-10 real companies)
- Updated output template with `### Geographic Focus` and `### Named Accounts` under `## Customer Profile`
- Added Monorepo Output Convention section to output spec
- Canonical 9 `##` sections preserved for downstream compatibility
- Applied to both claude/icp and codex/icp SKILL.md files

## 2026-03-28 — Add /monetization skill (49→50)

- Created `/monetization` skill (claude + codex) — research-driven monetization strategy with 3 validation checkpoints
- Covers: revenue model selection, value metric design, tier structure, price point anchoring, unit economics (CAC/LTV/payback), monetization timing, revenue diversification
- Reads upstream: icp, competitive-analysis, journey-map, metrics, gtm, customer-feedback, specs
- Outputs: research/monetization.md + research/monetization-interview.md
- Integrated into `/workflow`: staleness rules (stale when ICP or competitive data changes) + dependency graph
- Added to `/skills` stage mapping under Strategize
- Updated docs/skills-reference.md: count 49→50, new entry + quick reference row

## 2026-03-28 — Ship/ship-kanban: delegate to /workflow when no plan exists

- Replaced static suggestion list in `/ship` and `/ship-kanban` with `/workflow` delegation
- Both "no active plan" and "all phases complete" cases now run `/workflow` for context-aware next-step recommendation
- Updated claude/ship, claude/ship-kanban, codex/ship (3 files)

## 2026-03-28 — Add /hygiene skill and fix project-wide conventions (48→49)

- Created `/hygiene` skill (claude + codex) — audits project structure for convention violations with optional auto-fix mode
- Scopes: skills (frontmatter, sections), tasks (expected files), docs (reference sync), codex (mirror parity)
- Ran initial audit and fixed all errors/warnings:
  - Added missing `argument-hint` fields to 6 skills
  - Restructured 5 flat-format skills to use `## Process`/`## Output Format`/`## Constraints` headings (analyze-sessions, commit-and-push-by-feature, provision-agentic-config, plan-interview, ship-end)
  - Created 2 missing codex mirrors (poketo-kanban, skills)
  - Added `/competitive-analysis` to Quick Reference table
  - Synced 29 codex skill descriptions to match claude source of truth
- Updated docs/skills-reference.md: count 48→49, new `/hygiene` entry

## 2026-03-28 — Add contextual Next Steps to all 9 research skills

- Added `## Next Steps` section to all 9 research skill output templates (icp, competitive-analysis, enterprise-icp, journey-map, customer-feedback, gtm, metrics, mvp-gap, scale-audit)
- Claude skills (9): added "Populate Next Steps" process step with conditional logic (file existence checks) + `## Next Steps` in output template
- Codex skills (9): added Next Steps requirements to Deliverables + constraint enforcing format
- Each skill's suggestions are context-aware (3–5 items, "Pick one:" framing) — only includes commands whose prerequisites are met
- Replaced competitive-analysis's old `## Recommended Next Steps` (only suggested `/plan-interview`) with expanded contextual version
- 18 files modified, 165 lines added

## 2026-03-28 — Add 4 new skills: workflow, customer-feedback, gtm, metrics (44→48)

- Created `/workflow` skill — read-only diagnostic that scans project state, detects phase, checks staleness via timestamp comparison, and recommends next action
- Created `/customer-feedback` skill — append-only feedback ingestion with Confirmed/Wrong/New categorization against ICP and journey map, cumulative synthesis, staleness triggers at 3+ invalidated findings
- Created `/gtm` skill — interview-driven go-to-market planning (channel strategy, messaging, pricing, launch plan, 30/60/90 early traction tactics)
- Created `/metrics` skill — interview-driven success metrics framework (activation, engagement, retention, growth, business) tied to journey map stages with instrumentation gap tracking
- All 4 skills: Claude SKILL.md + Codex SKILL.md + Codex agents/openai.yaml (12 new files)
- Updated downstream skills to read new research outputs:
  - `/brainstorm` now reads customer-feedback.md (Wrong/New findings) and metrics.md (instrumentation gaps)
  - `/roadmap` now reads gtm.md (launch milestones) and metrics.md (instrumentation phases)
  - `/mvp-gap` now reads metrics.md (check if metrics are measurable)

- Updated docs/skills-reference.md: count 44→48, workflow diagram with Learn stage + feedback loop, 5 new entries, quick reference table
- install.sh: 4 new Claude + 4 new Codex symlinks installed

## 2026-03-28 — Research skills revamp + journey-map skill

- Revamped 3 research skills (icp, competitive-analysis, enterprise-icp) with present→validate→write pattern
  - All now report findings and validate with user via AskUserQuestion checkpoints before writing output
  - Output moved from `specs/` to `research/` directory (icp.md, competitive-analysis.md, enterprise-icp.md)
  - ICP: 3 checkpoints (candidates, scoring, cross-ICP); Competitive: 2 checkpoints (competitor list, full analysis); Enterprise: explicit present-findings step
- Added 2 new sections to /icp (v3.1.0): Trigger Events (ranked by frequency/urgency) and Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM with confidence levels)
- Canonical ICP format expanded from 7 to 9 sections
- Created `/journey-map` skill (v1.0.0) — maps user journeys (per-use-case task flows) and customer journey (trigger→discovery→aha→conversion→retention)
  - Prerequisites: research/icp.md + specs/*.md
  - Outputs: research/journey-map.md + research/journey-map-interview.md
  - Same present→validate→write pattern as other research skills
- Updated ~20 downstream skills referencing old specs/ paths to use research/
- Updated docs/skills-reference.md: 43→44 skills, workflow diagrams, quick reference table
- Consolidated run-step, run-phases, ship-then-plan into run and ship (JIT /plan-phases invocation)

## 2026-03-27 — Kanban production hardening specs

- Assessed kanban test results (61 tests, 3 layers all passing) for production readiness
- Identified 4 caveats: multi-user concurrency, load/stress testing, rollback/undo safety, Neon outage resilience
- Ran 7-turn /plan-interview to spec out test plans and new features
- Created `specs/kanban-production-test-plan.md` — 10 Claude-to-Claude race scenarios, 4 Claude + Web App races, progressive load profiling (50→500 cards, p50/p95/p99), 8 safety gate tests
- Created `specs/kanban-offline-queue-soft-delete.md` — offline write queue (better-sqlite3, 100-op limit, FIFO sync with conflict detection), soft-delete with 30-day TTL, restore/purge commands, ~40 new test cases
- Created `specs/kanban-production-hardening-interview.md` — full interview log with decisions and deviations

## 2026-03-27 — Revamp /icp skill: interview → research-driven

- Rewrote `claude/icp/SKILL.md` and `codex/icp/SKILL.md` from v1.0.0 to v2.0.0
- Replaced 7-area founder interview with automated web search + codebase analysis
- Now identifies 2-5 ICP candidates, scores on Value x Accessibility, selects primary
- Output: primary ICP in canonical 7 `##` sections (downstream-compatible) + Additional ICPs + Cross-ICP Analysis
- Research log in `research/icp-search-log.md` replaces `specs/icp-interview.md`
- Brief 1-2 question validation replaces full interview

## 2026-03-27 — Phase 9 Step 3: Skill versioning

- Added `version: 1.0.0` to all 43 `claude/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter files
- Created `scripts/skill-versions.sh` — version audit script with `--json` and `--missing` modes
- Created `docs/skill-versioning.md` — semver rules, bump guidelines, audit usage
- Phase 9 complete: skill discovery, dependency graph, and versioning all shipped

## 2026-03-27 — Phase 9 Step 2: Skill dependency graph

- Created `scripts/skill-deps.sh` — PCRE-based dependency graph and validation script
- 4 output modes: default (graph), `--broken` (broken refs only), `--dot` (Graphviz), `--json` (programmatic)
- Regex with negative lookbehind/lookahead prevents false positives on path fragments (`tasks/todo.md`, `/home/user`)
- Scanned 43 skills, found 22 with dependencies, 0 broken refs
- Exit code 0 if clean, 1 if broken refs found

## 2026-03-27 — Phase 9 Step 1: Skill discovery command

- Created `claude/skills/SKILL.md` — prompt-only skill that discovers all skills via Glob + Read
- Groups skills into 13 workflow stages using static mapping matching `docs/skills-reference.md` sections
- Supports two modes: `list` (default, all skills) and `search <keyword>` (filter by name/description)
- Updated `docs/skills-reference.md` — added `/skills` entry to Utility section and quick reference table, bumped count 42→43

## 2026-03-27 — Phase 8 Step 3: Env path unification

- Created `claude/poketo-kanban/scripts/env-paths.mjs` — shared `ENV_SEARCH_PATHS` array (4 paths)
- Updated `kanban.mjs` to import and use `ENV_SEARCH_PATHS` instead of inline `pokePaths` array
- Updated `bootstrap-session.mjs` to import and use `ENV_SEARCH_PATHS` instead of inline 2-path fallback (was missing monorepo variants)
- Added test in `bootstrap-session.test.mjs` verifying array length and absolute paths
- All 83 tests pass (82 existing + 1 new). Phase 8 complete.

## 2026-03-27 — Phase 8 Step 2: Dry-run mode for kanban write commands

- Added `hasBoolFlag` utility and `--dry-run` checks to all 8 write commands in `kanban.mjs`
- Each dry-run outputs `{ dryRun: true, command, wouldDo }` with planned operation details, returns before any DB write
- Updated help text with `[--dry-run]` on all write commands
- Added 3 tests: create-card, move-card, delete-board — verify preview output and no DB side effects
- All 82 tests pass (79 existing + 3 new)

## 2026-03-27 — Phase 8 Step 1: Add `--board` flag to kanban search

- Added `getAllArgs` utility to `kanban.mjs` for collecting repeated flag values
- Modified `cmdSearch` to accept `--board <id>` (repeatable) — validates board belongs to org, scopes search to specified boards; falls back to all-org-boards when omitted
- Updated help text for search command
- Added 2 new tests: scoped search returns only matching board's cards, invalid board ID returns error
- All 79 tests pass (77 existing + 2 new)

## 2026-03-27 — Phase 7 Step 4: Fix backslash LIKE escape

- Fixed `kanban.mjs` line 462: added `.replace(/\\/g, '\\\\')` before `%` and `_` escapes
- Converted `it.todo` in `kanban.test.mjs` to real test — creates card with backslash in name, verifies search finds it
- All 77 tests pass (76 existing + 1 new). Phase 7 complete.

## 2026-03-27 — Phase 7 Step 3: Database error path tests

- Added 5 tests in new `describe("Database error paths")` block to `kanban.test.mjs`
- Malformed UUID rejection, FK violation on create-card, FK violation on move-card, extremely long board name, concurrent duplicate board names
- All tests hit real Postgres errors (no mocks) — verifies `main().catch()` handler works
- All 76 tests pass (71 existing + 5 new)

## 2026-03-27 — Phase 7 Step 2: install.sh tests

- Created `claude/poketo-kanban/scripts/install.test.mjs` with 8 tests using vitest + child_process
- Used vitest (existing) instead of bats-core (plan suggested) — no new dependencies needed
- Tests isolate via temp dirs with `HOME` override: symlink creation (claude/codex), idempotency, warning on non-symlink targets, symlink update, uninstall (selective removal + count), directory creation
- All 71 tests pass (53 kanban + 10 bootstrap + 8 install)

## 2026-03-27 — Phase 7 Step 1: bootstrap session tests

- Refactored `bootstrap-session.mjs` for testability: exported `loadEnv(searchPaths?)`, extracted `buildConfig(user, org)`, guarded auto-run with `import.meta.url` check
- Created `bootstrap-session.test.mjs` with 10 tests across 2 describe blocks
- `loadEnv` tests (6): KEY=value parsing, double/single quotes, comments/blanks, missing files, file merge order
- `buildConfig` tests (4): all fields present, userId/orgId match, valid ISO timestamp
- All 63 tests pass (53 existing + 10 new). CLI still works as direct-run script.

## 2026-03-27 — Phase 6 Step 2: create-list, update-card flags, error paths, card ordering

- Added 19 new tests across 4 describe blocks to `kanban.test.mjs`
- create-list: name, auto-increment order, missing --name error, missing --board error
- update-card flags: --progress (set/reset), --description (set + falsy-guard on empty), --due, combined --due+--progress
- Additional error paths: invalid board/card IDs for create-card/create-list/archive-card/move-card, missing --list
- Card ordering: first card order 0, second card order 1, moved card appends, board insertion order
- Discovered: `--description ""` is no-op (falsy guard line 243), move-card/board responses omit card `order`
- All 53 tests pass (1 todo). Phase 6 complete.

## 2026-03-27 — Phase 6 Step 1: kanban edge case tests

- Added 11 edge case tests (10 runnable + 1 `it.todo`) to `kanban.test.mjs`
- Search: `%` escape, `_` escape, unicode/emoji search, backslash (todo — known bug deferred to Phase 7)
- Move: same-list move, invalid list ID error
- Archive: archive card, double-archive idempotency
- Create: empty name validation, 500-char long name
- Done: idempotent double-done
- All 34 tests pass (24 existing + 10 new), 1 todo. Total: 35 test entries.

## 2026-03-27 — Layer 3 e2e testing: skills 7-8 (complete)

- `/sync-roadmap-kanban` (skill 7) — PASS: board resolved from `.kanban-board`, all 9 roadmap phases compared with board, Phases 1-5 deliverables verified in codebase, 5 reconciliation rules applied (1 orphan flagged, 1 expected discrepancy flagged), sync report generated
- `/kanban-archive` (skill 8) — PASS: board validated, Done/Punt lists scanned, 30-day threshold applied, no cards old enough to archive (board created 2026-03-26), correctly reported nothing to archive
- **Layer 3 complete: 8/8 skills PASS. All 3 testing layers fully pass (Layer 1: 24 tests, Layer 2: 9 skills, Layer 3: 8 skills).**

## 2026-03-27 — Layer 3 e2e testing: skills 3-6

- `/roadmap-kanban` (skill 3) — PASS: existing roadmap detected, 4 new phases added, 2 cards moved Backlog→Todo, 3 future phase cards created in Backlog
- `/run-kanban` (skill 4) — PASS: card created In Progress with hostname/branch metadata, conflict check passed, plan mode entered, progress set to 0%
- `/ship-kanban` (skill 5) — PASS: 2 logical commits shipped, card stays In Progress (step not complete), commit SHAs added to description
- `/ship-end-kanban` (skill 6) — session wrap-up: uncommitted test results shipped, card `31e37110` moved In Progress → Done, commit refs added

## 2026-03-27 — Roadmap updated: Phases 6-9 added

- Roadmap revised from 5 completed phases to 9 total (4 new planned)
- Phase 6: Testing Hardening I (edge cases + command test expansion)
- Phase 7: Testing Hardening II (bootstrap, install.sh, DB error paths, backslash fix)
- Phase 8: Kanban DX (--board flag, dry-run mode, env unification)
- Phase 9: Skill Infrastructure (discovery, dependency graph, versioning)
- Small phases (2-3 items each) for incremental shipping
- todo.md preserved for ongoing Layer 3 validation work

## 2026-03-27 — Kanban Skill Validation complete: all 9 skills pass

- Updated `docs/kanban-test-results.md` with all results
- Generated `tasks/ideas.md` with brainstormed improvements (quick wins, medium efforts, larger initiatives)

## 2026-03-27 — Phase 5 complete: try/catch for malformed config JSON

- Wrapped `JSON.parse` in `loadConfig()` with try/catch, returns `null` with stderr warning
- All 24 kanban tests pass, all Phase 5 milestone criteria met
- Phase 5 complete — all 7 expert review fixes shipped

## 2026-03-26 — Phase 5 step 6: fix stale output paths in skills-reference

- Fixed `/plan-interview` output paths: `spec.md` → `specs/[topic].md`, `interview-log.md` → `[topic]-interview.md`
- Fixed `/plan-interview-ideas` output paths: "appends to spec.md" → "writes specs/[topic].md per idea"
- Phase 5 steps 1–6 complete, step 7 remains (config JSON try/catch)

## 2026-03-26 — Phase 5 step 5: add missing codex agent manifest

- Created `codex/plan-interview-ideas/agents/openai.yaml` — the only codex skill (1 of 41) missing an agent manifest
- All 41 codex skills now have `agents/openai.yaml`
- Phase 5 steps 1–5 complete, steps 6–7 remain (stale docs paths, config JSON try/catch)

## 2026-03-26 — Expert review + Phase 5 roadmap

- Ran `/expert-review` on full project — 7 confirmed findings after false-positive verification
- Critical: database credential in tracked `docs/kanban-test-results.md`, null dereference in `cmdArchiveCard`
- High: LIKE metachar injection in search, sequential list inserts in `cmdCreateBoard`
- Medium: missing codex `plan-interview-ideas` agent manifest, stale output paths in skills-reference
- Added Phase 5 to `tasks/roadmap.md` with 7 steps to resolve all findings

## 2026-03-26 — Phase 4 complete + kanban integration tests

- Phase 3 (Board Templates) archived from remote
- Added `archive-card` command to kanban.mjs (Phase 4 Step 1)
- Created `/kanban-archive` skill (Claude + Codex) — Phase 4 Step 2
- Updated `docs/skills-reference.md` with all 9 kanban skills (33 → 42 skills)
- **Phase 4 Archive Automation complete** — all roadmap phases (1-4) done
- Ran `/analyze-sessions` on 5,332 messages across 1,912 sessions:
  - `/ship` is dominant (537 invocations + 215 manual equivalents)
  - Kanban skills never used yet — testing needed before adoption
- Added `delete-board` command to kanban.mjs for test cleanup
- Created `kanban.test.mjs` — 24 integration tests against real Neon DB, all passing
  - Board lifecycle, card CRUD, card movement, search, error handling, cleanup
- Set up `~/.poketo/config.json` on this machine for kanban DB access
- Installed vitest as dev dependency for poketo-kanban scripts

## 2026-03-26 — Phase 4 Step 1: archive-card command (superseded by entry above)

- Phase 3 (Board Templates) completed on remote — archived to `docs/phases/phase-3.md`
- Added `archive-card --id <card-id>` command to kanban.mjs
  - Looks up card → list → board chain, moves card to board's archive list
  - Auto-creates "Archive" list and sets `archiveListId` on board if none exists
  - Follows existing patterns (cmdMoveCard, cmdCreateList)
- Created `/kanban-archive` skill (Claude + Codex) — bulk-archives Done/Punt cards older than N days
- Updated `docs/skills-reference.md` — added all 9 kanban skills section + quick reference entries (33 → 42 skills)

## 2026-03-25 — Kanban skill suite, board intelligence, board templates

### Phase 3: Board Templates (in progress)
- Added `--template standard` flag to kanban.mjs — creates board with 5 lists (Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done:done, Punt:punt) in one command
  - `--template` and `--lists` are mutually exclusive; unknown templates error with available list
  - Updated help text
- Updated Board Resolution protocol in all 12 -kanban SKILL.md files to use `--template standard` instead of verbose `--lists` string
- **Phase 3 Board Templates complete** — both steps done, milestone verified (0 old `--lists` matches, 12 `--template standard` matches)

### Earlier this session (pulled from remote)
Phases 1-2 completed, roadmap expanded with Phases 3-4.

### Original session

- Built and tested kanban-lite (SQLite) skill, then archived it after analysis showed Neon free tier costs ~$0 at our usage volume (~456 ops/month across all devices)
- Decision: stick with poketo-kanban + Neon for kanban — SQLite advantage is latency/simplicity, not cost
- Created `tasks/roadmap.md` with 3 phases: kanban-roadmap sync, cross-device agent awareness, proactive board intelligence
- Created `/sync-roadmap-kanban` skill (Claude + Codex) — Phase 1 Step 1 complete
  - Prompt-only skill that orchestrates poketo-kanban scripts, git commands, and file edits
  - 7-step process: sync → read kanban → read roadmap → check codebase → reconcile → apply → report
  - 5 reconciliation rules: done-on-kanban→roadmap, done-in-roadmap→kanban, new-items→cards, orphaned-cards→flag, false-done→flag
  - Set up `tasks/todo.md` for Phase 1 tracking
- Added board-project auto-detection — Phase 1 Step 2 complete
  - Auto-matches board name to repo directory name (case-insensitive substring)
  - Persists board ID in `tasks/.kanban-board` (committed to git for cross-device sharing)
  - Falls back to user prompt only when no match or ambiguous
- Added `--sync-kanban` opt-in flag to all workflow skills — Phase 1 Step 3 complete
  - 12 SKILL.md files updated (run, run-step, run-phases, ship, ship-end, ship-then-plan × Claude + Codex)
  - Flag triggers `/sync-roadmap-kanban` at session start; discrepancies shown but don't block
  - Phase 1 milestone complete: kanban-roadmap sync infrastructure in place
- **Phase 1 archived** to `docs/phases/phase-1.md`, transitioned to Phase 2
- Added session activity cards — Phase 2 Step 1 (later reverted)
- Reverted all kanban integration from workflow skills — decided to build separate `-kanban` skill suite instead
- Redesigned roadmap: 6 standalone `-kanban` skills (brainstorm, plan-interview, roadmap, run, ship, ship-end) with board ops baked in
- Fixed kanban.mjs `--lists` flag to support `name:type` annotations (e.g., `Done:done`, `Punt:punt`)
- Created `brainstorm-kanban` skill (Claude + Codex) — first of 6 kanban skill suite
  - Full copy of brainstorm + Board Resolution/Validation/Graceful Degradation protocols
  - Creates one Backlog card per idea (idempotent: skips existing cards)
- Created `plan-interview-kanban` skill (Claude + Codex) — 2nd of 6
  - Full copy of plan-interview + kanban sync: finds matching card by keyword search, updates with spec details
  - Searches all lists (not just Backlog), updates in place, never moves backward from Done/Punt
- Created `roadmap-kanban` skill (Claude + Codex) — 3rd of 6
  - Full copy of roadmap + kanban sync: current phase steps → Todo cards, future phases → Backlog summary cards
  - Moves matching Backlog cards to Todo, idempotent (skips existing)
- Created `run-kanban` skill (Claude + Codex) — 4th of 6 (most complex)
  - Full copy of run + session card (Todo → In Progress), cross-device conflict detection, stale session cleanup
  - Hostname/branch/time stored in card description; post-execution card update
- Created `ship-kanban` skill (Claude + Codex) — 5th of 6
  - Full copy of ship + Done/Punt card movement after shipping, next card ensured in Todo when planning
- Created `ship-end-kanban` skill (Claude + Codex) — 6th of 6, phase complete
  - Full copy of ship-end + moves In Progress card to Done with commit refs
- **Phase 1 Kanban Skill Suite complete** — all 6 skills built (18 files), kanban.mjs fixed, milestone verified
- Added Board Overview to 4 session-start kanban skills — Phase 2 Step 1
  - Surfaces overdue, starred, blocked cards + WIP/Backlog/Todo counts at session start
  - 8 SKILL.md files updated (run, brainstorm, roadmap, plan-interview × Claude + Codex)
- Added Next Work Suggestion to ship-end-kanban and ship-kanban — Phase 2 Step 2
  - After shipping, suggests top Todo card ranked by overdue > starred > list order
  - Falls back to Backlog if Todo empty, or "Board is clear" if nothing pending
- Added progress tracking to run-kanban — Phase 2 Step 3
  - Post-execution card update now includes `Progress: X/Y (Z%)` based on todo.md step counts
- **Phase 2 Proactive Board Intelligence complete** — board overview, next work suggestion, progress tracking all shipped
- Roadmap updated: added Phase 3 (board templates) and Phase 4 (archive automation) from backlog. Kanban analytics and Neon UI sync remain in backlog.

## 2026-03-24 — kanban-lite: local SQLite kanban skill

- Created new `/kanban-lite` skill — lightweight kanban boards stored in a local SQLite file, synced across machines via git commits
- Single dependency (`better-sqlite3`) with raw SQL — no ORM, no external DB, no auth
- Same CLI interface as `/poketo-kanban`: boards, board, create-card, update-card, done, move-card, create-board, create-list, search
- Added `sync` command for git pull/commit/push workflow to share board state across bismarck, desktop, and laptop
- WAL checkpoint on exit prevents `-wal`/`-shm` files from leaking into git
- Added `*.db-wal` and `*.db-shm` to `.gitignore`

## 2026-03-15 — Expert review fixes

Resolved all 10 findings from `/expert-review`:
- Fixed stale `/review` → `/expert-review` references in skills-reference.md
- Added missing `agents/openai.yaml` for brainstorm and debug codex skills
- Fixed unsafe `rm -rf` in install.sh codex path (now warns and skips like claude side)

## 2026-03-18 — Brainstorm output & plan-interview-ideas skill

- Updated `/brainstorm` (Claude + Codex) to append suggestions to `tasks/ideas.md`
- Created new `/plan-interview-ideas` skill (Claude + Codex) that reads `tasks/ideas.md` and runs a plan-interview for each idea sequentially
- Expanded brainstorm dimensions: added Strategic/Product tier (new features, new workflows, product line expansion) and reorganized into Strategic → Improvement → Hygiene

## 2026-03-20 — Spec-per-file, ship error fixing, project sync.md

- Moved spec output from single `spec.md` to individual `specs/[topic].md` files across `plan-interview` and `plan-interview-ideas` (Claude + Codex)
- Updated all downstream spec consumers (`roadmap`, `plan-phases`, `brainstorm`, `expert-review`) to check `specs/` directory with `spec.md` fallback
- Added "fix unrelated issues" constraint to all ship skills (`ship`, `ship-end`, `ship-then-plan` — Claude + Codex)
- Created project-level `sync.md` to run `install.sh` after pulls for symlink updates

## 2026-03-23 — False-positive verification & TDD test status clarity

- Added false-positive verification steps to `/expert-review` (step 6) and `/dead-code` (step 7) — both Claude + Codex
- Added explicit TDD test status reporting to summaries of `/run`, `/run-step`, `/ship`, `/ship-end`, `/ship-then-plan` (all Claude + Codex) — must state whether failing tests are expected (red phase) or unexpected (regressions)

## 2026-03-23 — Expert-review false-positive filter (superseded by entry above)

- Added step 6 "Verify findings" to `/expert-review` (Claude + Codex) — re-reads source code for every finding before reporting, drops unconfirmed findings, downgrades uncertain ones to Low

## 2026-03-20 — Sync skill: project-level sync.md support

- Added Step 5 (post-sync actions) to `/sync` skill (Claude + Codex)
- If `sync.md` exists at project root: parses and executes Dependencies, Conflict Resolution, Custom, and Notifications sections
- If `sync.md` doesn't exist: analyzes project, suggests a pre-filled `sync.md`, creates only with user approval
- Updated constraints for command failure handling, commented-out section skipping, and conflict resolution guidance

## 2026-04-02 — Roadmap: add Headless API Migration phase

- Audited Codex kanban skills against the local skill repo and Poketo monorepo headless surfaces
- Identified the main architectural gap: kanban skills still rely on direct Neon DB writes via `kanban.mjs`, and Codex variants depend on Claude-side install paths
- Added Phase 10 to `tasks/roadmap.md` to migrate Claude and Codex kanban workflows onto a shared Poketo headless API path
- Captured the concrete migration scope in the roadmap: agent-friendly auth, real Work tool wiring, shared gateway/API operations, Claude migration, Codex migration, and deprecation of the standalone DB-write path

## 2026-04-06 — Phase 10 Step 3: CLI kanban subcommand + key management (Gateway Phase 5)

- Implemented `poketo kanban` command with 12 subcommands mapping to gateway actions (board.getAll, board.getById, board.create, board.delete, list.create, card.create, card.update, card.move, card.markDone, card.archive, card.search, boardAction.list)
- Added `poketo auth create-key/list-keys/revoke-key/rotate-key` subcommands using session token auth
- Created table formatter (`format.ts`) for `--format table` output
- Fixed pre-existing tsconfig type errors by adding `types: ["node"]`
- All 37/37 CLI tests pass, typecheck clean
- Gateway Phase 5 milestone complete in Poketo monorepo

## 2026-04-07 — Skill shipping docs: align feature-branch push guard wording

- Verified that all repo-managed Claude and Codex skills are correctly symlinked into `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.codex/skills`
- Updated Codex shipping docs (`run`, `ship`, `ship-end`) to explicitly defer push behavior to `commit-and-push-by-feature`
- Updated Claude shipping docs (`ship`, `ship-end`) to remove unconditional "push current branch" wording and clarify that existing feature branches are commit-only

## 2026-04-08 — Shipping skills: require main/master landing + push

- Updated `commit-and-push-by-feature` in both Codex and Claude to resolve a primary branch (`main`, fallback `master`), move work there safely, and push there on success
- Updated `run`, `ship`, and `ship-end` in both Codex and Claude to treat `commit-and-push-by-feature` as an actual commit-and-push workflow targeting `main`/`master`
- Reflected the new shipping policy in `tasks/todo.md` current-state notes now that roadmap execution is complete
# 2026-04-13 — Refactor skills into global core and project-local packs

- Reorganized skill sources from flat `claude/` and `codex/` roots into `global/` and `packs/`.
- Added project-local pack management with `scripts/pack.sh` and global `/pack` / `$pack` skills.
- Moved business/product research workflows into the `business-app` pack; added initial `game` and `devtool` packs.
- Updated `install.sh` so global install includes only neutral core skills and cleans up old flat-root/stub links.
- Updated skill audit/version scripts, installer tests, pack tests, and docs for the new layout.

# 2026-04-13 — Split PoketoWork kanban into explicit opt-in packs

- Removed PoketoWork-specific `--kanban` modes and `poketo` tool permissions from global workflow skills.
- Added explicit `business-app-kanban`, `game-kanban`, and `devtool-kanban` packs containing only the six kanban workflow variants.
- Moved direct PoketoWork board utilities into the separate `poketowork-kanban` pack.
- Updated pack documentation and `scripts/pack.sh` so kanban variants are never installed implicitly by base domain packs.
- Verified skill dependency/version audits, pack install smoke tests, and the moved Poketo kanban test suite.

## 2026-04-14 — install.sh macOS Bash compatibility

- Fixed `install.sh` to avoid Bash nameref variables (`local -n`), which are unavailable in the macOS default Bash 3.2.
- Replaced nameref return values with a validated `printf -v` helper while preserving existing installer behavior and output.
- Fixed `scripts/pack.sh` empty-array writes under `set -u`, which surfaced as stderr during the pack removal test.
- Upgraded the Poketo kanban script package to `drizzle-orm` 0.45.2 to resolve the high-severity SQL identifier escaping advisory reported by `npm audit`.
- Verified `bash install.sh` succeeds on macOS Bash 3.2 and the Poketo kanban script test suite passes.

## 2026-04-16 — Research roadmap documentation queue

- Ran the queued `$research-roadmap` step after all implementation roadmap phases were complete.
- Inferred this repository as a devtool project from its skill-pack and CLI/documentation structure.
- Added a priority documentation queue to `tasks/todo.md` covering missing devtool research artifacts, missing docs-audit output, spec drift, and the follow-up roadmap refresh.
- Marked the prior `$research-roadmap` priority task complete and set the next action to `$devtool-user-map`.

## 2026-04-19 — Phase 11 Step 2: mode resolution

- Added optional `agent_mode` field to `.agents/project.json` schema (`claude-only | codex-only | hybrid`).
- Extended `scripts/pack.sh` with a `set-mode <mode|unset>` subcommand and made `install`/`remove`/`refresh` preserve an existing `agent_mode` value across rewrites.
- Added `scripts/agent-mode.sh` resolver: precedence `SKILLS_AGENT_MODE` env > `.agents/project.json` > empty string; invalid values hard-fail from both the setter and the resolver.
- Updated `docs/operating-modes.md` "Mode Signal" section to present-tense usage and mentioned the surface in `README.md`.
- Verified end-to-end on stock macOS Bash 3.2 in a scratch tmpdir: write/preserve across install/refresh, env override, `unset` clearing, and hard-fail on bogus values. No SKILL.md files consume the signal yet — that is Phase 11 Step 7.

## 2026-04-22 — Agent-team auto-dispatch for `/run` + `patch-exec-profile`

- Added `global/claude/patch-exec-profile/SKILL.md`: audits `agent-team` / `implementation-safe` execution profiles in `tasks/todo.md`, infers obvious `Mode` / `Depends on` values, flags ambiguous write lanes via `AskUserQuestion`, and validates disjoint `Owns` and acyclic lane DAGs.
- Updated `global/claude/run/SKILL.md` step 6b to auto-invoke `/patch-exec-profile` when an `agent-team` profile has missing or placeholder lane metadata, then build a lane DAG and topological waves for the plan-mode presentation. Added an `#### Agent-Team Dispatch` section specifying worktree-isolated `Agent` dispatch per write lane, write-boundary validation via `git diff --name-only`, integration via `git restore --source` (captures deletions, unlike `git checkout -- <paths>`), worktree/branch cleanup, and a blocker/advisory review-findings contract.
- Strengthened `global/claude/plan-phase/SKILL.md` guidance: `agent-team` profiles must fill concrete `Mode` / `Depends on` / `Owns` / `Must not edit` on every lane, with downgrade paths to `implementation-safe`, `research-only`, or `serial` otherwise.
- Registered `patch-exec-profile` in `README.md` global-core list and `docs/skills-reference.md` skills table. Ran `./install.sh` to symlink the new skill.
- Codex `/run` left unchanged — agent-team auto-dispatch is a Claude-side capability (requires `Agent` tool with `isolation: "worktree"`).

## 2026-04-22 — `$spec-drift` fix: approval-packet handoff wording

- Corrected `docs/operating-modes.md` § "Approval packet" (line 51) to stop claiming that `codex-only` cross-session handoff uses the shared approval packet. Packet-producing handoff is Claude-side only (`/handoff --target=codex`).
- Expanded the handoff row in the skills matrix (line 192) to disambiguate Claude `/handoff --target=codex` (produces packet) from Codex `$handoff` (writes prose only to `tasks/handoff.md`, no packet).
- Added a disambiguation note under `global/codex/handoff/SKILL.md` § "Constraints": `$handoff` does not write `.agents/approved-plan.json` or `tasks/approved-plan.md`; for packet-gated resume, use Claude-side `/handoff --target=codex` + `$run --execute-approved`.
- Recorded the fix in `specs/drift-report.md` and checked off the queue item in `tasks/todo.md` § "Priority Documentation Todo". Doc-only change; no skill, schema, or script behavior touched.

## 2026-04-29 — Add first-class UAT skill and clarify dogfood scope

- Added mirrored `uat` skills for Claude and Codex focused on target-user acceptance journeys, role-based criteria, and evidence capture.
- Updated `dogfood` in both platforms to remove the former UAT-proxy framing and define dogfood as owner/operator adoption into the builder's workflow.
- Registered `uat` in the global skill docs and added a `dogfood` reference entry to `docs/skills-reference.md`.
- Verified skill metadata and dependency references with `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken` and `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`.

## 2026-04-30 — Devtool monetization research artifact

- Created `research/devtool-monetization.md` from the completed devtool research chain, especially `research/devtool-positioning.md`.
- Recommended preserving the free/local-first core and monetizing team enablement, private pack design, maintained pack subscriptions, advisory implementation, and a future optional managed layer only after repeated demand.
- Covered free/open-source boundaries, packaging, usage limits, team conversion, enterprise triggers, unit economics, pricing anchors, and monetization risks.
- Marked `$devtool-monetization` complete in `tasks/todo.md` and planned the next queue item, `$spec-drift fix all`.

## 2026-04-30 — Spec drift refresh after project fleet orchestration

- Archived the previous drift report to `docs/history/archive/2026-04-30/180205/specs/drift-report.md`.
- Replaced `specs/drift-report.md` with a fresh `$spec-drift fix all` audit covering the current spec inventory and recent 2026-04-30 changes.
- Verified active specs against implementation/docs: approval-packet schema, code-quality pack layout and aliases, Poketo headless migration status, and legacy kanban fallback banners.
- Found no Error or Warning drift requiring user arbitration or implementation work.
- Recorded one Info finding: `$project-fleet` is a public Codex skill documented in README and linked from `clone-spec-store`, but it has no dedicated canonical spec yet. Deferred optional `specs/project-fleet.md` until the workflow needs durable spec coverage.
- Marked `$spec-drift fix all` complete in `tasks/todo.md` and planned a `$research-roadmap` refresh as next work.

## 2026-04-30 — Bootstrap repo skill

- Added mirrored `bootstrap-repo` skills under `global/claude/` and `global/codex/`.
- The new skill writes or preserves `README.md` from a user-supplied project brief, prompts when the brief is missing, and delegates agent workflow doc setup to `provision-agentic-config`.
- Added Codex UI metadata in `global/codex/bootstrap-repo/agents/openai.yaml`.
- Registered the skill in the global core lists in `README.md` and `docs/skills-reference.md`.

## 2026-04-30 — Research roadmap refresh after documentation queue completion

- Re-ran `$research-roadmap` after completing devtool positioning, monetization, and spec-drift refresh work.
- Inferred the repository as a devtool project from repo signals and `packs/devtool` because `.agents/project.json` is absent.
- Confirmed canonical documentation roots are top-level `research/`, `specs/`, and `tasks/`.
- Confirmed the six fallback devtool research outputs are present and current: `research/devtool-user-map.md`, `research/devtool-integration-map.md`, `research/devtool-dx-journey.md`, `research/devtool-adoption.md`, `research/devtool-positioning.md`, and `research/devtool-monetization.md`.
- Promoted the one remaining default-flow devtool documentation item: `$devtool-docs-audit` to create `research/devtool-docs-audit.md`.
- No record or recurring documentation advisory tasks were needed.

## 2026-05-01 — Devtool contextual next-skill routing

- Confirmed the reported gap: `$research-roadmap` referenced the devtool default flow, but its fallback devtool map omitted `$devtool-docs-audit`, and the individual devtool pack skills did not emit contextual next-skill guidance.
- Added `## Next-Skill Routing` to all mirrored devtool pack skills for Claude and Codex.
- Updated `devtool-docs-audit` so it writes `research/devtool-docs-audit.md`, allowing research-roadmap to track the artifact.
- Added docs audit to both research-roadmap fallback maps and documented the full devtool order through the final research-roadmap confirmation pass.
- Verified with targeted grep checks, `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash ./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, and `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash ./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`. Direct script invocation still uses macOS Bash 3.2 in this shell and fails on the scripts' existing associative arrays.

## 2026-05-01 — Devtool final-response next-skill enforcement

- Tightened all 16 mirrored devtool pack skills so `## Output` explicitly requires the final response to include `Recommended next skill: <command>`.
- Kept the existing `## Next-Skill Routing` sections as the decision logic for choosing the command.
- Verified the explicit output requirement appears in all mirrored devtool skills, and reran `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash ./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken` plus `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash ./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`.

## 2026-05-02 — Phase 12 Step 12.1: creator platform capability matrix

- Added mirrored `creator-platform-capability-matrix` skills under `packs/creator-media/claude/` and `packs/creator-media/codex/`.
- Defined the required output path `research/creator-platforms/capability-matrix.md`, baseline platform rows, collection method vocabulary, matrix columns, operational risk levels, evidence-gap handling, and next-skill routing to `creator-evidence-schema`.
- Verified the new skill contracts with targeted `rg` scans, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-02 — Phase 12 Step 12.2: creator evidence schema

- Added mirrored `creator-evidence-schema` skills under `packs/creator-media/claude/` and `packs/creator-media/codex/`.
- Defined the required output path `research/creator-platforms/evidence-schema.md`, raw evidence root `research/creator-platforms/data/<platform>/<slug>/`, normalized evidence fields, metrics object, confidence rules, privacy notes, evidence-gap handling, and next-skill routing.
- Verified the new skill contracts with targeted `rg` scans, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-02 — Phase 12 Step 12.4: creator-media next-skill routing

- Tightened mirrored Claude/Codex routing in `creator-platform-capability-matrix` so the default final response emits `Recommended next skill: creator-evidence-schema`.
- Tightened mirrored Claude/Codex routing in `creator-evidence-schema` so `creator-presence-dossier` is preferred when present, with fallback to platform-specific audits or `creator-positioning`.
- Preserved the YouTube-only shortcut while making non-YouTube and mixed-platform work keep the foundation before platform-specific audits.
- Verified with targeted routing scans, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-02 — Phase 12 Step 12.5: creator evidence regression coverage

- Recorded full regression validation coverage for the Phase 12 creator platform evidence foundation acceptance criteria in `tasks/todo.md`.
- Confirmed mirrored foundation skill frontmatter names, required output paths, collection method vocabulary, normalized schema fields, confidence/privacy fields, LinkedIn baseline language, pack-doc routing, and Step 12.4 next-skill routing.
- Verified with targeted `rg` scans, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-02 — Phase 12 Step 12.6: repository validation gate

- Ran the formal Phase 12 repository validation gate after the targeted regression coverage.
- Confirmed `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken` reports `No broken references found.`.
- Confirmed `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing` reports `All 267 skills have a version field.`.
- Confirmed `git diff --check` produces no output.
- Planned Step 12.7 to inspect wording consistency and avoid source churn unless concrete drift is found.

## 2026-05-02 — Phase 12 Step 12.7: creator foundation wording consistency

- Compared the mirrored Claude/Codex `creator-platform-capability-matrix` and `creator-evidence-schema` skill contracts after the validation gate.
- Confirmed the only mirror diffs are expected command syntax differences (`/skill` for Claude, `$skill` for Codex).
- Confirmed creator-media pack docs and public references consistently route non-YouTube or mixed-platform work through `creator-platform-capability-matrix` and `creator-evidence-schema` before platform-specific audits while preserving the YouTube-only shortcut.
- Made no source-doc wording edits because no concrete drift was found.
- Verified with targeted `diff`/`rg` scans, `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-02 — Phase 12 complete and Phase 13 planned

- Archived the completed Phase 12 working document to `tasks/phases/phase-12.md`.
- Marked Phase 12 complete in `tasks/roadmap.md`, including acceptance criteria and completion notes.
- Planned Phase 13 just in time from `specs/creator-platform-evidence-schema.md`, with a serial execution profile and focused steps for mirrored `creator-presence-dossier` contracts, dossier sections, pack/docs wiring, downstream routing, and validation.
- Replaced `tasks/todo.md` with the Phase 13 working plan and a self-contained Step 13.1 handoff.

## 2026-05-02 — Phase 13 Step 13.1: creator presence dossier contracts

- Added mirrored `creator-presence-dossier` skills under `packs/creator-media/claude/` and `packs/creator-media/codex/`.
- Defined the required output path `research/creator-presence/<slug>.md`, Phase 12 foundation reads, normalized/raw evidence citation requirements, public/professional evidence boundaries, supported source families, and final-response next-skill routing.
- Verified the new skill contracts with targeted `rg` scans, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-04 - Phase 26 Step 26.1: monorepo pack contract

- Added `packs/monorepo/PACK.md` to define the monorepo pack, V1 skill inventory, augmentation injection pattern, pnpm workspace + Turborepo target, package-scope tags, V1/V2 boundary, and relationship to existing global monorepo skills.
- Marked Step 26.1 complete in `tasks/todo.md` and recorded the quality-gate manifest for the documentation/workflow contract change.
- Verified with targeted contract scans and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-02 — Phase 13 Step 13.2: creator presence dossier Markdown contract

- Expanded mirrored `creator-presence-dossier` skills with a section-by-section Markdown dossier contract.
- Added evidence register requirements for source path or URL, capture date, source family, public/private boundary, confidence level, supported claims, and evidence gaps.
- Defined confidence level rules and kept required source-family support for LinkedIn, personal websites/blogs, GitHub, podcasts, talks, newsletters, and product docs.
- Verified the mirrored contract with targeted `rg` scans, normalized Claude/Codex diff, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-02 — Phase 13 Step 13.3: creator presence dossier docs wiring

- Added `creator-presence-dossier` to the creator-media pack docs, README, and skills reference after `creator-evidence-schema`.
- Placed the dossier before platform-specific audits or strategy synthesis in creator-media default flows.
- Documented that the dossier feeds `creator-positioning`, `content-programming`, `product-led-media-map`, and `creator-metrics-review` while preserving the YouTube-only shortcut.
- Verified the docs wiring with targeted `rg` scans, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-02 — Phase 13 Step 13.4: downstream creator-media dossier routing

- Tightened mirrored `creator-evidence-schema` routing so mixed-platform, LinkedIn-first, career-signal/career signal, owned-presence/owned presence, personal website, GitHub-profile, podcast, talk, newsletter, and professional bio work recommends `creator-presence-dossier` when the skill is present.
- Updated `creator-positioning`, `content-programming`, `product-led-media-map`, and `creator-metrics-review` to prefer `research/creator-presence/<slug>.md` as optional creator context when present.
- Preserved the existing YouTube-only flow by keeping channel audit and raw YouTube evidence as the source of channel-only and performance claims.
- Verified with targeted routing scans, normalized mirror diff for `creator-evidence-schema`, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-07 - Phase 32 Step 32.1: skills showcase static shell

- Added the `docs/skills-showcase/` static website foundation with direct-reloadable home, workflows, packs, catalog, inspect, and follow routes.
- Added shared `styles.css` and `app.js` for the responsive Swiss grid/blueprint motif, sticky/mobile navigation, workflow selector behavior, and sample catalog filtering without adding dependencies or a runtime framework.
- Kept generated catalog/proof data, stale-data validation, and skill mutation contract prompts scoped to later Phase 32 steps with honest placeholder states in the shell.
- Verified with `node --check docs/skills-showcase/app.js`, route file presence checks, targeted route/data-hook scans, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-08 — Skills Showcase hero overlap hotfix

- Investigated the homepage hero layout after a report that the text was cut off by the right-side blueprint diagram.
- Confirmed the root cause was the original asymmetric 5/7 hero grid plus oversized viewport-scaled headline and a late `900px` stacking breakpoint.
- Updated `docs/skills-showcase/styles.css` to use balanced desktop columns, prevent grid item overflow, stack the hero at compact desktop widths, and wrap/tighten the stacked headline and blueprint text.
- Refreshed the generated GitHub proof fingerprint after the showcase data validator reported stale generated data.
- Verified with `scripts/validate-skills-showcase-data.sh`, `node --check docs/skills-showcase/app.js`, `git diff --check`, and local Brave visual checks at desktop and narrow widths.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 35 Step 35.1: benchmark coverage matrix

- Added `tests/harness/bench-coverage.ts` with a committed 143-skill coverage matrix, repository skill discovery, coverage row projection, and validation for missing rows, missing custom setup paths, and incomplete blocked rows.
- Added the `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage` CLI and layer1 tests for the coverage contract.
- 2026-05-11 — Phase 35 Step 35.2: coverage-aware benchmark reporting
  - Wired benchmark coverage rows into setup resolution with explicit custom/generic/blocked target metadata.
  - Updated `pnpm bench --list-skills` and `pnpm bench --skill <skill>` to report coverage status, while preserving generic fallback for repository skills that do not yet have custom setups.
  - Added layer1 tests for custom metadata, generic fallback metadata, blocked row resolution, coverage-status listing, and CLI list output.
  - Verified with targeted `bench-setups.test.ts`, `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage`, `pnpm --dir tests bench --list-skills`, full layer1 tests, a zero-run `run` CLI status smoke, and `git diff --check`.

- Marked the first four Phase 35 acceptance criteria complete while preserving generic smoke coverage for later migration to custom or blocked statuses.
- Verified with `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage`, targeted `bench-setups.test.ts`, full layer1 tests, `pnpm --dir tests verify --skill design-system --layers 1`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-03 — Phase 13 Step 13.5: creator presence regression coverage

- Recorded focused regression validation coverage for the Phase 13 creator presence dossier acceptance criteria in `tasks/todo.md`.
- Confirmed mirrored dossier skill frontmatter names, required output path, required Markdown sections, public/private evidence boundary rules, source/capture/confidence/evidence-gap fields, supported source families, pack-doc routing, downstream strategy routing, and final-response next-skill language.
- Verified with targeted `rg` scans, `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-03 — Phase 13 Step 13.6: repository validation gate

- Ran the formal Phase 13 repository validation gate after the focused regression coverage.
- Confirmed `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken` reports `No broken references found.`.
- Confirmed `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing` reports `All 269 skills have a version field.`.
- Confirmed targeted `rg` scans still cover mirrored dossier contracts, required sections, evidence boundaries, supported source families, pack-doc routing, downstream strategy routing, and final-response next-skill language.
- Confirmed `git diff --check` produces no output.
- Planned Step 13.7 to inspect wording consistency and avoid source churn unless concrete drift is found.

## 2026-05-03 — Verification-only handoff cleanup and Phase 13 close

- Updated Claude/Codex workflow instructions so routine clean verification runs inside the active execution/shipping step instead of opening a separate plan-mode handoff.
- Updated `/run`, `/ship`, `$run`, `$ship`, and both `/plan-phase`/`$plan-phase` templates to fold conditional no-op cleanup into Green validation unless verification finds concrete remediation work.
- Folded the Phase 13 conditional wording-cleanup step into Step 13.6 because validation had already passed and no source-doc drift was found.
- Marked Phase 13 acceptance criteria, phase tests, and regression checks complete in the task docs.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 21 Step 21.1: quality gate contract

- Added `docs/quality-gate-contract.md` as the reusable quality-gate contract for mutation and shipping skills.
- Defined non-trivial mutation scope, the Plan/Implement/Self-review/Quality sweep/Verification/Ship manifest flow, required ship-manifest fields, skipped-test and residual-risk standards, adversarial review expectations, user-correction handling, and direct-to-primary compatibility.
- Verified with a targeted contract-topic scan and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 21 Step 21.2: ship manifest validator

- Added `scripts/ship-quality-gate.sh`, a dependency-light manifest validator for the required quality-gate fields.
- Added complete and intentionally incomplete fixtures under `tests/fixtures/ship-quality-gate/`.
- Verified the complete fixture passes, the incomplete fixture fails with expected missing-field output, and `git diff --check` is clean.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 21 Step 21.3: global quality-gate skill contracts

- Updated `$run`, `$ship`, `$ship-end`, and `$commit-and-push-by-feature` to require the `docs/quality-gate-contract.md` ship manifest for non-trivial mutations before commit/push.
- Required manifest coverage for changed files, per-file purpose, user-goal mapping, tests run, skipped tests, adversarial review, residual risk, rollback note, and next command.
- Required targeted adversarial review for non-trivial source changes and made final outputs distinguish executable verification from documentation-only or task-only checks.
- Verified with targeted contract-field scans across the four global skills and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 21 Step 21.5: focused quality-gate validation

- Ran the focused quality-gate validator checks for the complete and intentionally incomplete ship-manifest fixtures.
- Confirmed the complete fixture passes and the incomplete fixture fails with the expected missing fields: `Per-file purpose`, `User-goal mapping`, `Skipped tests`, `Adversarial review`, `Residual risk`, and `Rollback note`.
- Confirmed targeted contract scans cover quality-gate references and required manifest fields across the global shipping skills, canonical contract, validator script, and complete fixture.
- Verified the task-documentation shipping diff with `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 21 Step 21.6: repository validation gate and phase close

- Ran the formal Phase 21 repository validation and review gate.
- Confirmed `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken` reports `No broken references found.`.
- Confirmed `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing` reports `All 287 skills have a version field.`.
- Confirmed `./scripts/skill-next-step-routing.sh --missing` reports `All 211 mutation-capable skills have next-step routing.`.
- Confirmed `git diff --check` produces no output.
- Archived the completed phase to `tasks/phases/phase-21.md`, marked Phase 21 complete in `tasks/roadmap.md`, and replaced `tasks/todo.md` with a no-active-phase handoff that routes next discovery to `$brainstorm`.
- Ran the post-roadmap `$research-roadmap` scan; existing devtool research, specs, roadmap, and task docs are current, with no priority documentation, record, or recurring item promoted.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 14 Step 14.4: LinkedIn lane contract coverage

- Added `tests/layer1/creator-media-linkedin.test.ts` to assert the mirrored LinkedIn foundation and dossier contracts include baseline sources, privacy/redaction gates, normalized dossier routing, and forbidden access patterns.
- Tightened `packs/creator-foundation/PACK.md` with the exact `creator-platform-capability-matrix -> creator-evidence-schema -> creator-presence-dossier` LinkedIn route.
- Tightened `packs/creator-media/PACK.md` so compatibility docs carry the same owner-provided, admin-provided, or already-authorized analytics boundary as README and the skills reference.
- Verified with the focused layer1 LinkedIn contract test, targeted `rg` scans, full `pnpm --dir tests test`, skill dependency/version/routing audits, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-04 — Phase 14 Step 14.5: final LinkedIn lane validation and phase close

- Ran the final focused Phase 14 validation gate for LinkedIn baseline/evidence handling, owner exports, manual snapshots, public unauthenticated captures, user-provided files, privacy/redaction language, schema/dossier routing, and forbidden scraping/API/private collection patterns.
- Confirmed `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `./scripts/skill-next-step-routing.sh --missing`, `pnpm --dir tests test`, and `git diff --check` all pass.
- Marked Phase 14 acceptance criteria complete in `tasks/roadmap.md`, archived the completed phase to `tasks/phases/phase-14.md`, and replaced `tasks/todo.md` with a no-active-phase handoff.

## 2026-05-05 — Cross-pack next-step routing guard

- Audited recommendation-like cross-pack skill references and found 95 Claude/Codex skill contracts that could tell users to run a pack-local skill without first requiring the target pack to be enabled.
- Added a standardized Pack Availability Guard to affected global, business, creator-foundation, youtube-ops, and remotion contracts.
- Added `scripts/skill-pack-routing-audit.sh` and wired it into README and the next-step contract audit evidence.
- Verified with `bash -n scripts/skill-pack-routing-audit.sh`, `./scripts/skill-pack-routing-audit.sh`, `./scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken`, `./scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing`, `./scripts/skill-next-step-routing.sh --missing`, `pnpm --dir tests test`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 35 Step 35.5: Tier 2/3 global benchmark coverage

- Added grouped custom Codex benchmark setups for 32 deterministic Tier 2/Tier 3 global skills.
- Marked 9 global skills as blocked with concrete reasons and next commands for push/deploy/release/sync, local installation, and Claude-only workflows.
- Registered the grouped setup module, updated the coverage matrix, preserved pack generic fallback for Step 35.6, and cached repository skill discovery to keep full layer1 tests stable.
- Verified with focused `bench-setups.test.ts`, `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage`, `pnpm --dir tests bench --list-skills`, zero-run `affected` benchmark smoke, full `pnpm --dir tests test:layer1`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 35 Step 35.6: pack benchmark coverage

- Added grouped custom Codex benchmark setups for pack skills with deterministic local fixtures and assertion coverage.
- Registered `PACK_WORKFLOW_SETUPS` and updated the coverage matrix so every current pack row resolves to custom coverage instead of generic fallback.
- Preserved the generic fallback path through synthetic-row test coverage and added a guard that fails if any current pack skill remains generic.
- Verified with focused `bench-setups.test.ts`, `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage`, `pnpm --dir tests bench --list-skills`, zero-run `youtube-video-audit` benchmark smoke, full `pnpm --dir tests test:layer1`, generic-pack-row scan, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 35 Step 35.7: future skill benchmark coverage enforcement

- Updated mirrored shared-skill creation, local-skill promotion, and targeted skill-builder workflows so new or materially updated repository skills must update the benchmark coverage matrix and add custom coverage or an explicit blocked row.
- Updated benchmark-test-skill pack contracts to report custom/generic/blocked status, stop on blocked rows, and route missing custom coverage to targeted-skill-builder.
- Added the benchmark coverage freshness contract to `docs/skills-reference.md` and refreshed generated Skills Showcase assets.
- Verified with Skills Showcase generation/validation, `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage`, focused `bench-setups.test.ts`, skill dependency/version/routing audits, full `pnpm --dir tests test:layer1`, `./install.sh`, targeted contract scans, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 35 Step 35.8: validation and benchmark review

- Ran the Phase 35 validation gate for benchmark coverage, setup registry, reporting, runner behavior, coverage-status list output, standard skill audits, and representative live Codex benchmark setups.
- Fixed validation-discovered harness defects: benchmark runs now resume only with `--resume`, compatible resume manifests must match the requested benchmark config, and infrastructure-blocked rate-limit classification only applies to non-zero agent exits.
- Hardened custom setup assertions for case-insensitive expected text and Markdown next-command headings, and clarified the benchmark-test-skill setup prompt's expected `$ship` route.
- Verified with focused layer1 tests, `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage`, `pnpm --dir tests bench --list-skills`, one-run Codex benchmarks for `run`, `plan-phase`, `benchmark-test-skill`, and `youtube-video-audit`, full `pnpm --dir tests test:layer1`, skill dependency/version/routing audits, `./install.sh`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 35 Step 35.9: final benchmark coverage regressions and phase close

- Added `tests/layer1/bench-coverage.test.ts` for final benchmark coverage contract regressions: complete matrix validation, missing rows, duplicate/unknown rows, missing custom setup paths, blocked row reason/next-command failures, custom/generic/blocked status resolution, generic fallback retention, CLI status output, and blocked preflight behavior.
- Extended `tests/layer1/runner.test.ts` with exact resume-config matching and non-zero rate-limit infrastructure-block classification coverage.
- Refreshed stale generated Skills Showcase proof data discovered by `scripts/validate-skills-showcase-data.sh`.
- Verified with focused layer1 tests, `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage`, `pnpm --dir tests bench --list-skills`, full `pnpm --dir tests test:layer1`, one-run Codex benchmarks for `run`, `plan-phase`, `benchmark-test-skill`, and `youtube-video-audit`, skill dependency/version/routing/pack audits, Skills Showcase freshness validation, and `git diff --check`.
- Marked Phase 35 complete in `tasks/roadmap.md`, archived it to `tasks/phases/phase-35.md`, and replaced `tasks/todo.md` with a no-active-phase handoff to `$brainstorm`.

## 2026-05-11 — run benchmark route assertion fix

- Fixed the `run` custom benchmark setup so route assertions are agent-aware: Claude is evaluated against `/ship`, while Codex remains evaluated against `$run`.
- Passed benchmark runner context into custom setup assertions and added focused layer1 coverage for the agent-specific route behavior.
- Verified with focused layer1 tests, benchmark coverage validation, and one-run live benchmarks for both `run` Claude and Codex runners.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 36 Step 36.4: setup-facing benchmark quality helpers

- Added `tests/layer4/setup-helpers/quality.ts` with reusable setup-facing quality criterion builders for required facts, concrete file and command references, specificity, reference traits, next-route checks, and forbidden fabrications.
- Refactored the existing `run` benchmark quality rubric to use the helper API while preserving its threshold and hard assertion behavior.
- Added focused layer1 coverage proving the helper-composed rubric passes the strong fixture and fails the hallucinated fixture.
- Verified with `pnpm --dir tests test:layer1 -- bench-quality bench-setups runner`, `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 36 Step 36.5: Tier 1 workflow quality rubrics

- Added deterministic output-quality rubrics for all Tier 1 workflow benchmark setups: `run`, `ship`, `ship-end`, `roadmap`, `plan-phase`, `feature-interview`, `spec-interview`, `investigate`, `session-triage`, `targeted-skill-builder`, and `benchmark-test-skill`.
- Kept the rubrics fixture-bound with evidence facts, concrete file references, route handoffs, validation/evidence specificity, workflow-specific trait checks, and fabricated-content guards.
- Extended setup registry coverage so every Tier 1 workflow setup must expose a quality evaluator, with representative rubric ID checks for shipping, investigation, and benchmark reporting.
- Verified with `pnpm --dir tests test:layer1 -- bench-quality bench-setups runner`, `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 36 Step 36.6: global and design-system quality rubrics

- Added deterministic output-quality rubrics for `design-system`, `design-system-draftstonk`, and grouped Tier 2/Tier 3 global workflow benchmark setups.
- Scored design-system outputs for fixture token facts, Stitch frontmatter shape, component/token reference coverage, and fabricated design values.
- Scored global workflow outputs for required fixture terms, setup-specific evidence patterns, expected next routes, workflow actionability, and generic/external overreach guards.
- Extended setup registry tests for design-system and representative high-signal global quality evaluator discovery while preserving no-evaluator compatibility for generic fallback setups.
- Verified with `pnpm --dir tests test:layer1 -- bench-quality bench-setups runner`, `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 36 Step 36.7: pack-family quality rubrics

- Added deterministic output-quality rubrics for grouped pack workflow benchmark setups across creator, business, game, devtool, monorepo, kanban, project-fleet, remotion, and YouTube families.
- Scored pack outputs for exact pack/skill context, local fixture evidence, practical risk or validation specificity, `$run` next-route handoff, family context, workflow traits, and unsupported external overreach guards.
- Extended setup registry tests for representative pack-family evaluator discovery and added a strong-versus-generic pack quality regression.
- Verified with red-first `pnpm --dir tests test:layer1 -- bench-setups`, green `pnpm --dir tests test:layer1 -- bench-quality bench-setups runner`, `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 36 Step 36.8: benchmark quality workflow contracts

- Updated mirrored shared-skill creation, local-skill promotion, and targeted skill-builder contracts so future custom benchmark setup work must include deterministic output-quality rubrics when practical or record an explicit blocked/deferred quality rationale.
- Updated Codex and Claude `benchmark-test-skill` pack contracts to report hard assertion pass rate separately from optional output-quality score, include quality threshold failures in failure routing, and avoid presenting small benchmark runs as statistically definitive.
- Added the quality-rubric requirement to `docs/skills-reference.md` and refreshed generated Skills Showcase data after tracked skill contract changes.
- Verified with Skills Showcase generation/validation, skill dependency/version/routing audits, targeted contract scans, focused layer1 benchmark report/setup tests, benchmark coverage validation, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 36 Step 36.9: final quality benchmark validation and phase close

- Ran the Phase 36 validation gate for benchmark quality primitives, report rendering, setup registry behavior, runner persistence, coverage status, coverage matrix integrity, CLI list output, standard skill audits, and whitespace diff checks.
- Ran representative one-run Codex benchmarks with quality scoring for `run`, `investigate`, `design-system`, and `run-kanban`; all final runs passed hard assertions and produced quality scores in the report output.
- Fixed a validation-discovered false negative in the `investigate` benchmark setup: the diagnostic-only fixture now requires an actionable next-command handoff without forcing the literal `$run` route.
- Marked Phase 36 acceptance criteria complete in `tasks/roadmap.md`, archived the completed phase to `tasks/phases/phase-36.md`, and replaced `tasks/todo.md` with a no-active-phase handoff to `$brainstorm`.

## 2026-05-11 — UI variant evaluation route

- Added Codex `ui-consolidate` and aligned Claude/Codex UI workflow contracts so layout variants flow through requirements-only UI interviewing, layout-mode UX variation, UAT variant evaluation, and then consolidation.
- Updated UAT, UX variation, UI consolidation, skills discovery, design-system routing, canonical workflow docs, next-step contracts, and skills reference to require evaluation evidence before consolidation unless the user explicitly says they have already reviewed variants.
- Moved `ui-consolidate` from blocked benchmark coverage to a custom deterministic setup.
- Refreshed Skills Showcase generated assets after tracked skill metadata changed.
- Ship manifest:
  - User goal: Apply the variant-evaluation workflow so built UI variants route through UAT evidence before `ui-consolidate`.
  - Changed files: `docs/canonical-workflow-report.md`, `docs/skill-next-step-contracts.md`, `docs/skills-reference.md`, `docs/skills-showcase/assets/github-proof-data.js`, `docs/skills-showcase/assets/skills-data.js`, `global/claude/skills/SKILL.md`, `global/claude/uat/SKILL.md`, `global/claude/ui-consolidate/SKILL.md`, `global/claude/ux-variation/SKILL.md`, `global/codex/design-system/SKILL.md`, `global/codex/skills/SKILL.md`, `global/codex/uat/SKILL.md`, `global/codex/ui-consolidate/SKILL.md`, `global/codex/ui-consolidate/agents/openai.yaml`, `global/codex/ui-interview/SKILL.md`, `global/codex/ux-variation/SKILL.md`, `tasks/history.md`, `tasks/lessons.md`, `tasks/todo.md`, `tests/harness/bench-coverage.ts`, `tests/layer1/bench-setups.test.ts`, `tests/layer4/setups/tier23-global-workflows.setup.ts`.
  - Per-file purpose: UI/UAT/consolidation skill files define the variant evaluation workflow and Codex consolidation skill; discovery/reference docs expose the new route; generated showcase assets reflect skill metadata; benchmark files and harness/setup tests add custom coverage and evidence; task docs record the correction and shipping boundary.
  - User-goal mapping: The shipped boundary preserves the user-corrected lesson that consolidation can be premature and makes the route enforceable through skill contracts and benchmark coverage.
  - Tests run: `./install.sh` passed; `scripts/validate-skills-showcase-data.sh` passed; `node --check docs/skills-showcase/app.js` passed; `pnpm --dir tests test:layer1 -- bench-setups.test.ts` passed with 10 files and 1245 tests; `pnpm --dir tests bench:coverage` passed with 143 skills; `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken` passed; `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing` passed with 317 versioned skills; `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash scripts/skill-next-step-routing.sh --missing` passed with 230 mutation-capable skills routed; targeted `rg` scans confirmed requirements-only, layout-mode, variant-evaluation, and consolidation routing language; `git diff --check` passed.
  - Skipped tests: Full live agent benchmarks were not run because the change is skill-contract and deterministic coverage work, not a live product implementation.
  - Adversarial review: Diff-aware self-review checked that consolidation is gated on evaluation evidence, UAT remains human-run, Codex/Claude route syntax is platform-correct, `ui-consolidate` has version/frontmatter/routing coverage, and generated assets are fresh.
  - Residual risk: The new `ui-consolidate` Codex skill has deterministic benchmark coverage but has not yet been exercised in a live multi-turn UI consolidation session; the first real use should verify the evidence gate asks for UAT results at the right time.
  - Rollback note: Revert the UI variant route commits and regenerated showcase assets to remove `ui-consolidate` as a Codex skill and restore the prior direct variation-to-consolidation route.
  - Next command: `$brainstorm`

## 2026-05-11 — ship benchmark agent review

- Reviewed the persisted `ship` benchmark outputs from `tests/benchmarks/runs/ship-claude-726530ae/` and `tests/benchmarks/runs/ship-codex-b69cb187/`.
- Created `benchmark/review-ship-2026-05-11.md` with subjective agent-review scores, common strengths and weaknesses, rubric-tightening recommendations, and a concrete next command.
- The review found all evaluated outputs usable, but not excellent: median subjective score 79, range 74-88. The deterministic report already caught the main gap with `evidence-linked` scoring at 0.0% for both runners.
- Recommended next work: tighten the `ship` benchmark rubric for retained artifact text, evidence-linked manifest fields, and full manifest-completeness checks.

## 2026-05-11 — Phase 37 Step 37.1: Skills Showcase Next.js shell

- Created a self-contained `apps/skills-showcase` Next.js app shell with package scripts, Next config, strict TypeScript config, root App Router layout, baseline global CSS, and a canonical public route inventory.
- Kept the dependency surface limited to Next, React, React DOM, TypeScript, and type packages; no Neon, tRPC, TanStack Query, admin auth, database package, generated-data path, or GitHub Actions change was introduced.
- Verified current package versions with `npm view`, parsed the new JSON files with Node, and passed `git diff --check`.
- Marked Step 37.1 complete in `tasks/todo.md` and prepared Step 37.2 to port the existing static route hierarchy into the App Router.

## 2026-05-11 — Spec reconciliation archive cleanup

- Included pre-existing spec reconciliation edits from the shared tree in the shipping boundary so the repository does not retain dirty tracked changes after `$run`.
- Preserved stale kanban specs by moving them from `specs/` into `docs/history/archive/2026-05-11/165500/specs/`; archived copies match the deleted HEAD blobs. Also archived a copy of `poketo-headless-auth-migration.md` while keeping the active spec updated.
- Reran Skills Showcase data validation after source-fingerprint churn; the validator passed on the second run once regenerated proof data matched the current source tree.

## 2026-05-11 — Skills Showcase proof data refresh

- Refreshed `docs/skills-showcase/assets/github-proof-data.js` after the latest shipped history/spec commit changed the generated proof source fingerprint and recent history list.
- Verified with `scripts/validate-skills-showcase-data.sh`, `node --check docs/skills-showcase/app.js`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-12 — Step 37.3: Migrate showcase styling and client interactions

- Ported the full Swiss grid/blueprint CSS from `docs/skills-showcase/styles.css` into `apps/skills-showcase/app/globals.css` — custom properties, grid system, component styles, responsive breakpoints, and animations.
- Created `ShowcaseShell.tsx` ("use client") for mobile menu toggle and Escape-key dismissal.
- Created `workflows.tsx` ("use client") for the 8-workflow selector, step animation with autoplay/pause, progress indicators, and workflow preview grid on the home page.
- Created `catalog.tsx` ("use client") for catalog search/filter/platform interactions, pack map with filter/overlay/detail panel, proof rendering on the inspect page, and follow proof receipts.
- Created `newsletter-form.tsx` ("use client") for the follow page newsletter form state machine (provider-missing, invalid-email, pending, success, error).
- Wired all client components into their respective pages and the root layout. Added `.gitignore` for `.next/` and `node_modules/`.
- Verified: `pnpm typecheck` passes, `pnpm build` produces 6 static routes, dev server renders styled pages with all data attributes present.

## 2026-05-12 — Step 38.3: Set up tRPC server with newsletter router

- Created `src/trpc/init.ts` with tRPC v11 context factory (cookie-based admin session parsing), base router, `publicProcedure`, and `protectedProcedure` (validates session cookie against `NEWSLETTER_ADMIN_SECRET`).
- Created `src/trpc/newsletter.ts` with four procedures: `subscribe` (Zod v4 email validation, idempotent upsert, no DB error leaks), `adminLogin` (secret comparison, HTTP-only secure cookie), `adminList` (search/limit/offset), `adminExport` (CSV-formatted active subscribers).
- Created `src/trpc/router.ts` merging newsletter sub-router, exporting `AppRouter` type.
- Created `app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts` using `fetchRequestHandler` from `@trpc/server/adapters/fetch`.
- Verified: typecheck clean, build shows `/api/trpc/[trpc]` as dynamic route, 54/54 showcase tests + 1302 layer1 tests green.

### Step 38.4: tRPC client, TanStack Query provider, and layout integration (2026-05-12)
- Created `src/trpc/client.ts` — typed `createTRPCReact<AppRouter>` binding.
- Created `src/trpc/provider.tsx` — `"use client"` provider with `QueryClientProvider` + `trpc.Provider` using `httpBatchLink({ url: "/api/trpc" })`.
- Updated `app/layout.tsx` — wrapped body contents with `<TRPCProvider>`.
- Verified: typecheck clean, build passing, 54/54 showcase tests green.

### Step 38.5: Refactor newsletter form to use tRPC subscribe mutation (2026-05-12)
- Rewrote `src/showcase/newsletter-form.tsx` from imperative DOM manipulation to React component with `useState` + `trpc.newsletter.subscribe.useMutation()`.
- Removed `provider-missing` state (first-party endpoint eliminates the need).
- Updated `app/follow/page.tsx` — replaced static form markup with `<NewsletterFormClient />`, removed `data-provider-endpoint`.
- Updated `src/showcase/smoke.test.tsx` — added tRPC client mock for FollowPage rendering.
- Rewrote `src/showcase/newsletter-form.test.tsx` — mock tRPC hooks instead of DOM + fetch mocking.
- Verified: typecheck clean, build passing, 52/52 showcase tests green.

## 2026-05-12 — Benchmark-backed showcase demos

- Added benchmark-backed demo rendering to the G Skillmap catalog cards so skills with persisted run artifacts can show a representative prompt and output excerpt alongside pass-rate, latency, cost, and quality metrics.
- Sanitized generated benchmark demo excerpts to remove local temporary run directories while preserving artifact names and links to the persisted run JSON.
- Refreshed Skills Showcase generated data and proof assets for both the archived static path and the Next.js app public assets.
- Verified with focused layer1 generated-data coverage, focused showcase catalog tests, app typecheck, showcase data validation, and whitespace checks.

## 2026-05-12 — Step 39.1: Generate benchmark-results-matrix.md from persisted reports

- Replaced hand-maintained `docs/benchmark-results-matrix.md` with a generated artifact produced by `scripts/generate-skills-showcase-data.mjs`.
- Generator scans `tests/benchmarks/runs/*/report.json` (filesystem, not git-tracked), cross-references curated `benchmark/test-*.md` reports and `benchmark/review-*.md` subjective reviews, and writes a graded table (14 rows) and incomplete table (5 rows).
- Added `.sort()` for deterministic filesystem directory ordering.
- Added `docs/benchmark-results-matrix.md` to `scripts/validate-skills-showcase-data.sh` freshness checks.
- Added `tests/layer1/benchmark-results-matrix.test.ts` asserting generated matrix content.
- Verified: 12 test files / 1304 tests passed, showcase data validation fresh.
