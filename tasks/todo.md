# Current Research - Managed Skill Library SaaS Prompt

## Status

Research and prompt drafting complete.

## Plan

- [x] Capture prompt history and local package context.
- [x] Research current competitor and adjacent product surfaces.
- [x] Draft the separate-repo `$idea-scope-brief` prompt.
- [x] Verify source links and diff hygiene.
- [x] Record review notes, commit, and push intended artifacts.

## Review

- Read the active `idea-scope-brief` skill contract and used it as the target prompt format, while keeping the actual deliverable separate from a canonical idea-brief run.
- Confirmed local `skillpacks` context from `README.md`, `packages/skillpacks/package.json`, and `docs/skillpacks-npm-distribution.md`.
- Researched skills.sh public positioning, docs, CLI, API, audit page, and official-skills directory.
- Researched adjacent Claude Skills, Agent Skills standard, OpenAI GPT/agent surfaces, and recent agent-skill ecosystem/security papers.
- Wrote the reusable prompt at `research/managed-skill-library-saas-prompt.md`.
- Verified the prompt distinguishes sourced facts from hypotheses and preserves the core gap question: managed/private/white-label SaaS versus public directory/CLI package.

## Next Work

No immediate implementation work remains for this prompt-preparation task.

# Previous Implementation - Landing Redesign Complete

## Status

No active implementation phase is currently selected.

## Review

- Landing redesign (staged journey Select → Open → Build + light/dark theme) for
  `apps/skills-showcase` was implemented across 6 phases and shipped on 2026-06-21
  (commits `07ee9941`..`ebca5806`). See `tasks/history.md` for the full record.
- The deck-routing morph/mount-id contract is preserved — full
  `e2e/deck-table-shell.spec.ts` suite passes via the new `revealTable()` helper.
- Verified: `tsc` clean, Vitest 133/133, Playwright 45/45, `next build` OK, plus
  light/dark screenshot QA.
- Unified Experience Phases 1–7 remain complete (archived under `tasks/phases/`).
- `tasks/manual-todo.md` contains only deferred production newsletter setup tasks
  from Phase 38; they do not block current development.
- `tasks/recurring-todo.md` has 2 advisory items, but advisory queues are not
  selected by `$exec`.
