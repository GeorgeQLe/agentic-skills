# All Planned Phases Complete

**Status:** Roadmap complete as of 2026-04-07.

**Last completed step:** Phase 10 Step 6 — Deprecate the standalone DB-write path

## Priority Documentation Todo

- [ ] `$devtool-user-map` - create/update `research/devtool-user-map.md` because the repo infers as a devtool project and the canonical research output is missing.
- [ ] `$devtool-integration-map` - create/update `research/devtool-integration-map.md` after `$devtool-user-map`; currently blocked because `research/devtool-user-map.md` is missing.
- [ ] `$devtool-dx-journey` - create/update `research/devtool-dx-journey.md` after `$devtool-integration-map`; currently blocked because `research/devtool-integration-map.md` is missing.
- [ ] `$devtool-adoption` - create/update `research/devtool-adoption.md` after `$devtool-dx-journey`; currently blocked because `research/devtool-dx-journey.md` is missing.
- [ ] `$devtool-positioning` - create/update `research/devtool-positioning.md` after `$devtool-adoption`; currently blocked because `research/devtool-adoption.md` is missing.
- [ ] `$devtool-monetization` - create/update `research/devtool-monetization.md` after `$devtool-positioning`; currently blocked because `research/devtool-positioning.md` is missing.
- [ ] `$devtool-docs-audit` - create/update `research/devtool-docs-audit.md` after `$devtool-monetization`; currently blocked because `research/devtool-monetization.md` is missing and no docs-audit artifact exists for the devtool default flow.
- [ ] `$spec-drift fix all` - reconcile `specs/*.md` against implementation because source changes are newer than the latest spec evidence: commit `975c823` (`feat(code-quality): add quality sweep skill`, 2026-04-16 12:38:47 -0400) updated `packs/code-quality/.../quality-sweep` after `specs/code-quality-skill-pack.md` was last modified on 2026-04-13 09:52:16.
- [ ] `$roadmap` - create/update `tasks/roadmap.md` and `tasks/todo.md` after `$spec-drift fix all`; currently blocked because specs may be stale, and `specs/code-quality-skill-pack.md` (2026-04-13 09:52:16) is newer than `tasks/roadmap.md` (2026-04-07 22:58:31).

## Priority Task Queue

- [x] `$research-roadmap` - refreshed `tasks/todo.md` with priority documentation items because all roadmap phases are complete and the next useful project action is a research/documentation health scan.

## Final Step Outcome

- [x] Legacy helper messaging now points standard usage at `poketo kanban`
- [x] `kanban.mjs` remains available only as fallback/admin tooling during rollout
- [x] Active skill/docs verification still shows no standard-use dependency on `POKETOWORK_DATABASE_URL`
- [x] Active Codex skill/docs verification still shows no `~/.claude/.../kanban.mjs` dependency

## Current State

- Archived final phase snapshot to `tasks/phases/phase-10.md`
- No unchecked phases remain in `tasks/roadmap.md`
- No active `tasks/manual-todo.md` file is present
- Skill sources now use the two-layer `global/{claude,codex}` plus `packs/<pack>/{claude,codex}` layout
- Base `business-app`, `game`, and `devtool` packs do not include PoketoWork kanban behavior; `*-kanban` and `poketowork-kanban` packs are explicit opt-ins
- Skill frontmatter `argument-hint` values were normalized to quoted YAML scalars so Codex skill loading no longer trips on inline bracket syntax
- Shipping skills now define `commit-and-push-by-feature` as landing commits on `main`/`master` and pushing there when the workflow succeeds
- Research-oriented Codex skills now default to self-sufficient, first-principles analysis and ask for constraints or factual corrections instead of relying on user intuition
- Pack management now supports guided no-argument setup, multi-pack install/remove, aliases, project lock protection, and skill-local launcher scripts
- Pack install/remove/refresh now tells users to start a fresh Claude Code or Codex CLI session when changed project-local skills are not visible
- Added the `code-quality` pack with the first `extract-shared-types` skill for behavior-preserving type extraction refactors
- `research-roadmap` now front-loads missing and stale documentation work into `tasks/todo.md` instead of only reporting read-only status
- Research/spec-writing skills now require archive-first replacement: before substantively rewriting existing canonical docs, snapshot the old file under `docs/history/archive/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS/<original-relative-path>` and then update the canonical path

## Next Action

Start with `$devtool-user-map` from the priority documentation todo, or start a new spec and roadmap cycle if new work is being introduced.
