# Claude Skills

A shared skill library for **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex** that provides 60 structured workflows spanning the full product lifecycle — from customer discovery through shipping, deployment, and post-launch analysis.

Skills are markdown-defined prompts that extend AI coding assistants with opinionated, multi-step workflows. Each skill lives in its own directory as a `SKILL.md` file and is installed via symlinks into each tool's global skills directory.

## Installation

```bash
# Install — symlinks skills into ~/.claude/skills/ and ~/.codex/skills/
./install.sh

# Uninstall — removes only symlinks pointing back to this repo
./install.sh --uninstall
```

The installer creates symlinks from each tool's global skills directory to the corresponding source directory in this repo:

- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` → `claude/<name>/`
- Codex: `~/.codex/skills/<name>/` → `codex/<name>/`

Each tool only sees its own skills. Existing symlinks that point elsewhere are updated; non-symlink files at the target path are skipped with a warning.

## Platform Differences: Claude Code vs Codex

Both platforms share the same skill library but differ in how they handle workflow transitions:

| Capability | Claude Code | Codex |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Invocation syntax | `/skill-name` | `$skill-name` |
| Plan mode from skills | Yes — skills can enter plan mode | No — only available when session is already in Plan mode |
| Structured approval gates | Yes — multiple-choice approval in plan mode | No — plain-text approval in normal chat |
| Clear-context transition | Yes — tool-managed fresh implementation context | No — manual thread restart required |
| Workflow state | Split between tool state and repo files | Repo files only (`tasks/todo.md` is the primary contract) |

### What this means in practice

- **Research and documentation skills** (icp, competitive-analysis, journey-map, etc.) port well to both platforms with no workflow gaps.
- **Planning skills** (plan-interview, roadmap, plan-phases) work on both but Codex uses plain-text questions instead of structured multiple-choice.
- **Execution skills** (run, ship, migrate) work fully in Claude Code. In Codex, the recommended pattern is: plan in one thread → stop → execute in a fresh thread from `tasks/todo.md`.

### Codex Workflow Cycle

For non-trivial work in Codex, the recommended cycle is:

1. **Planning thread** — run `$plan-interview`, `$roadmap`, `$plan-phases`, or `$run` to prepare the plan
2. **Approval** — review and approve in normal chat
3. **Stop** — end the thread (manual context shedding)
4. **Fresh execution thread** — execute from `tasks/todo.md`, reading only necessary files
5. **Ship** — run `$ship` to compress state for the next thread
6. **Repeat** — start a new planning or execution thread

See [docs/codex-workflow.md](docs/codex-workflow.md) for the full translation guide.

### Skills only available in Claude Code

Three skills currently exist only in the Claude Code variant:

| Skill | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| `/branch-lifecycle` | Relies on interactive approval gates for merge/cleanup |
| `/burn-rate` | Not yet ported |
| `/spec-drift` | Not yet ported |

Default git policy for this library: solo-dev work should land directly on the repository primary branch (`main` when present, otherwise `master`). Shipping, release, and deploy skills should move work onto the primary branch and push there; feature-branch workflows are exception-only.

## Workflow Overview

Skills form a structured pipeline across the product lifecycle:

```
Discover          Ideate              Specify             Map            Strategize        Execute              Ship               Evaluate          Learn
───────────       ──────────────      ─────────────       ──────────     ──────────        ───────────────      ──────────────      ──────────        ────────────
/icp          →   /brainstorm     →   /plan-interview →   /journey-map → /roadmap     →    /run            →   /ship          →   /mvp-gap      →   /customer-feedback
/competitive-     └→ /plan-            /plan-phases        /metrics       /gtm              /run --phase         /ship-end          /scale-audit          ↓
  analysis           interview-                                           /monetization                          /deploy            /expert-review   (back to Discover)
/enterprise-icp      ideas                                                /positioning                           /release           /regression-check
                                                                                                                                    /spec-drift
```

**At any point**: `/workflow` checks status, stale items, and recommends the next step.

**Supporting skills** plug in wherever needed: `/expert-review`, `/investigate`, `/debug`, `/trace`, `/affected`, `/dead-code`, `/slim-audit`, `/hygiene`, `/research-reconcile`.

### Kanban Workflow

A parallel set of `-kanban` skills that manage board state (via Poketo/Neon Postgres) alongside their normal operations. Board lists follow the lifecycle: **Backlog → Todo → In Progress → Done → Punt**.

| Skill | Description | Base Skill |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| `/brainstorm-kanban` | Brainstorm ideas and create Backlog cards for each | `/brainstorm` |
| `/plan-interview-kanban` | Interview to spec, then update matching kanban card with spec summary | `/plan-interview` |
| `/roadmap-kanban` | Build roadmap, sync phases to Todo cards and future work to Backlog | `/roadmap` |
| `/run-kanban` | Execute next step with card tracking (Todo → In Progress) and cross-device conflict detection | `/run` |
| `/ship-kanban` | Ship work, move card to Done or Punt, ensure next card in Todo | `/ship` |
| `/ship-end-kanban` | Wrap session, move In Progress card to Done with commit refs | `/ship-end` |
| `/sync-roadmap-kanban` | Reconcile board state with roadmap docs and codebase reality (non-destructive) | — |
| `/kanban-archive` | Archive old Done/Punt cards (default: 30+ days) | — |
| `/poketo-kanban` | Low-level board CRUD — list boards, view state, create/update/move cards, search | — |

### Ops & Utility

| Skill | Description | Arguments |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| `/skills` | Browse and search all available skills grouped by workflow stage or activity type | `[list\|types\|search <keyword>]` |
| `/install-workflow-orchestration` | Install workflow orchestration instructions into a repository's `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` | none |

---

## Activity Types

Each skill has a `type` in its frontmatter describing the kind of work it does (orthogonal to workflow stage):

| Type | What it does | Output | Skills |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| **research** | Web search + analysis | Documents, market insights | `icp`, `enterprise-icp`, `competitive-analysis`, `gtm`, `monetization`, `positioning`, `customer-feedback`, `research-reconcile` |
| **analysis** | Reads codebase/docs | Assessments, gap reports | `mvp-gap`, `scale-audit`, `journey-map`, `metrics`, `burn-rate`, `runway-model`, `workflow`, `spec-drift`, `affected`, `dead-code`, `hygiene`, `slim-audit`, `analyze-sessions`, `assumption-tracker`, `cohort-review`, `retro`, `risk-register`, `investor-update`, `experiment` |
| **planning** | Interactive interviews | Specs, roadmaps, phases | `brainstorm`, `plan-interview`, `plan-interview-ideas`, `roadmap`, `plan-phases`, and their `-kanban` variants |
| **execution** | Writes/modifies code | Code changes | `run`, `scaffold`, `migrate`, `decommission`, and `run-kanban` |
| **review** | Reads code, reports issues | Review reports (no changes) | `expert-review`, `regression-check`, `trace` |
| **debugging** | Investigates + fixes | Root cause + fix | `investigate`, `debug` |
| **shipping** | Commits, deploys, wraps up | Commits, releases, handoffs | `ship`, `ship-end`, `release`, `deploy`, `commit-and-push-by-feature`, `handoff`, `sync`, and their `-kanban` variants |
| **ops** | Manages boards, branches, tooling | Board/branch state changes | `poketo-kanban`, `kanban-archive`, `branch-lifecycle`, `sync-roadmap-kanban`, `skills`, `install-workflow-orchestration` |

---

## Kanban Integration

The kanban system uses **Poketo** backed by **Neon Postgres** with **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe SQL.

### Architecture

- **Board discovery**: `tasks/.kanban-board` file stores the board ID, auto-detected by kanban skills
- **CLI**: `kanban.mjs` provides 11 commands for board operations
- **Multi-user coordination**: optimistic locking, audit logging (agentSessionId, hostname, timestamp), cross-device conflict detection (scans In Progress for other hostnames)
- **Test coverage**: 83 tests via vitest

### Card Lifecycle

```
/brainstorm-kanban → creates Backlog cards
/plan-interview-kanban → specs the card (updates description)
/roadmap-kanban → moves current phase to Todo, future to Backlog
/run-kanban → moves to In Progress (warns on conflicts)
/ship-kanban → moves to Done or Punt
/kanban-archive → archives old Done/Punt cards
```

---

## File Contracts

These repo files are the shared workflow surface, especially important for Codex where repo files replace tool-level workflow state:

| File | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `tasks/roadmap.md` | Long-range phased plan with acceptance criteria | Created by `/roadmap`, updated by `/plan-phases` and `/ship` |
| `tasks/todo.md` | Current phase execution contract (the primary handoff artifact) | Created by `/plan-phases`, marked up by `/run` and `/ship` |
| `tasks/manual-todo.md` | Human-only tasks linked to automated steps via `_(blocks: ...)_` and `_(after: ...)_` annotations | Created by `/plan-phases`; checked by `/run`; unchecked `_(blocks: ...)_` items can block phase transition in `/ship` |
| `tasks/history.md` | Append-only execution log | Updated by `/ship` and `/ship-end` |
| `tasks/handoff.md` | Optional session summary for cold starts | Created by `/handoff` |
| `tasks/deploys.md` | Deployment history ledger with commit ranges | Created/updated by `/deploy` |
| `tasks/ideas.md` | Future skill and feature ideas | Updated by `/brainstorm` |
| `tasks/.kanban-board` | Board ID for kanban skills | Auto-created on first kanban skill use |
| `specs/*.md` | Validated specifications | Created by `/plan-interview` |
| `research/*.md` | Research documents (ICP, competitive, journey, etc.) | Created by research skills |
| `docs/debug-changelog.md` | Debug history for recurring issues | Updated by `/debug` |

---

## Skill Dependencies

Skills communicate through repo state files, not through tool-specific messaging. Key dependency chains:

### Research Chain
```
/icp (foundational)
 ├── /competitive-analysis (requires ICP for competitive frame)
 ├── /journey-map (requires ICP + specs)
 │    └── /metrics (requires journey-map)
 ├── /gtm (requires ICP)
 ├── /monetization (requires ICP)
 ├── /mvp-gap (requires ICP)
 └── /customer-feedback (enriched by ICP + journey-map)
```

### Execution Chain
```
/plan-interview → /roadmap → /plan-phases → /run → /ship
                                                     └── (phase transition) → /plan-phases → /run → ...
```

### Cross-Cutting
- `/research-reconcile` audits consistency across all research docs
- `/workflow` detects staleness by comparing git history with research doc dates
- `/spec-drift` verifies specs match implementation after any execution
- Research skills now include **downstream impact checking** — after writing their document, they scan dependent docs for conflicts and recommend `/research-reconcile` if major impacts are found

### Validation Script

```bash
# Check for broken cross-references between skills
bash scripts/skill-deps.sh

# Output formats
bash scripts/skill-deps.sh --broken    # Only broken references
bash scripts/skill-deps.sh --dot       # Graphviz DOT format
bash scripts/skill-deps.sh --json      # JSON output
```

---

## Versioning

All skills use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) in their `SKILL.md` frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
version: 1.2.0
---
```

| Bump | When |
|------|------|
| **Major** (2.0.0) | Breaking changes — removed flags, renamed arguments, changed output format |
| **Minor** (1.1.0) | New capability without breaking existing behavior |
| **Patch** (1.0.1) | Bug fixes without interface changes |

### Audit

```bash
bash scripts/skill-versions.sh              # Table of all skills with versions
bash scripts/skill-versions.sh --json       # JSON output
bash scripts/skill-versions.sh --missing    # Only skills missing versions
```
