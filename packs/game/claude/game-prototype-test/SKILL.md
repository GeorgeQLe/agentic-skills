# Game Prototype Test

## Alignment-YAML Routing

While an alignment page is in `review`, the only next action is section-feedback YAML or final compiled YAML from the bottom compile controls. Do not include `Recommended next skill`, `Recommended next command`, or downstream routing language. The approval request itself is the next action. Only emit next-skill routing after the approved artifact has been written or updated.

Design the smallest playable test that can prove or disprove the game's core fun.

## Output

Write or update `research/game-prototype-test.md` with prototype scope, test questions, playtest script, observation checklist, success criteria, and cut/keep/amplify decisions.

## Next-Step Routing

After writing the artifact, recommend the next contextual game-pack skill in the final response as `Recommended next skill: <command>`.

Default recommendation: `/game-playtest-metrics`.

If prototype, playtest, or market evidence invalidates an upstream assumption, route back to the earliest affected artifact (`/game-audience`, `/game-fantasy`, `/game-genre-map`, or `/game-comparables`) and explain the evidence. Otherwise, follow the default game sequence:

`/game-audience` -> `/game-fantasy` -> `/game-genre-map` -> `/game-comparables` -> `/game-core-loop` -> `/game-prototype-test` -> `/game-playtest-metrics` -> `/game-store-page-test` -> `/game-launch` -> `/game-roadmap`

If the next artifact already exists and is current, recommend `/game-workflow` to identify the first missing or stale game-pack artifact.

## Task Classification

When this skill produces follow-up work, file it by execution semantics:

- Immediately actionable implementation or documentation work goes in `tasks/todo.md`.
- Human-only external actions tied to automated steps go in `tasks/manual-todo.md` with `_(blocks: Step N.X)_` or `_(after: Step N.X)_`; repo edits, SDK wiring, generated assets, local commands, tests, audits, and authenticated CLI/API work stay in `tasks/todo.md`.
- One-time condition-gated records, baselines, or future measurements go in `tasks/record-todo.md` with source, condition, non-blocking reason, evidence, and promotion rule.
- Cadence-based reviews, playtests, adoption checks, investor updates, retros, or docs-health checks go in `tasks/recurring-todo.md` with cadence, owner/agent, next due, evidence path, and escalation conditions.
- Do not put non-blocking records or recurring obligations in `tasks/todo.md` unless they have been explicitly promoted into current execution work.

## Context Gathering

**Step 1 — Scope questions.** Before researching, ask the user 1–3 questions via `AskUserQuestion` to understand: their product/service, target audience, and what they hope to learn or decide from this research.

**Step 2 — Research.** Conduct research scoped by the user's answers.

**Step 3 — Findings validation.** Before building the alignment page, present the 3–5 most important findings and ask the user to validate or correct any critical assumptions.


## Briefing Slides Review Surface

Follow the shared briefing-slides convention via the packaged convention resolver. When this skill creates or amends a dense review artifact, keep building and updating the dense `alignment/*.html` and/or `interrogation/*.html` pages exactly as this skill already requires. Also build or update `briefing-slides/game-prototype-test-{topic}.html` as the primary human review UI.

Treat the briefing slide deck as the artifact to open for review. Link the dense pages, source documents, and any other context artifacts from slide reference chips or other clickable slide elements so reviewers can drill into detail without losing the slide-first review flow.

The compiled deck YAML must route back to `/game-prototype-test`. Include the dense review pages and source artifacts in `reference_pages` / `source_artifacts`, preserve unanswered gates and slide feedback, and only mark the deck ready when the slide gates are approved.

After artifact creation or amendment, attempt to open only the briefing slide deck. Do not auto-open the linked dense pages.
## Alignment Page

Follow the shared alignment-page convention via the packaged convention resolver; output path is `alignment/game-prototype-test-{topic}.html`.

## Default Shipping Contract

Follow the shared shipping contract convention in CLAUDE.md.
