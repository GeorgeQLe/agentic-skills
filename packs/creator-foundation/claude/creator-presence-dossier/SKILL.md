# Creator Presence Dossier

Invoke as `/creator-presence-dossier`.

## Report-First Approval Gate

Default to report-only: present findings, evidence coverage, assumptions, recommended artifact path, and proposed file changes in a pre-approval alignment page plus a concise conversation summary for user approval before creating or updating canonical research, spec, or task files.

Do not write or overwrite synthesized deliverables until the user explicitly approves, unless the user invoked an explicit write/update/fix mode or clearly asked to write files upfront. Raw evidence capture may be persisted before analysis when reproducibility requires it; report those raw paths separately and still gate synthesized research/report writes.

When stopping for approval, build and attempt to open the alignment preview page first, then ask the user to review it and approve, question, or request adjustments. Do not include `Recommended next skill`, `Recommended next command`, or downstream routing language. The approval request itself is the next action. Only emit next-skill routing after the approved artifact has been written or updated.

Build or update a durable Markdown dossier for a creator's public and professional footprint before platform-specific audits or strategy synthesis.

## Workflow

1. Identify the creator, project slug, platforms, and existing evidence paths from the user request and repo context.
2. Read `research/creator-platforms/capability-matrix.md` if it exists. If it is missing, recommend `/creator-platform-capability-matrix` before synthesis.
3. Read `research/creator-platforms/evidence-schema.md` if it exists. If it is missing, recommend `/creator-evidence-schema` before synthesis.
4. Inspect available normalized and raw creator evidence under `research/creator-platforms/data/<platform>/<slug>/` and any user-specified evidence paths.
5. Cite the normalized evidence paths, raw evidence paths, source URLs, and capture dates used before making claims.
6. Write or update `research/creator-presence/<slug>.md`.
7. Separate public/professional evidence from private repo planning context. Exclude private planning context unless the user explicitly asks to preserve it as internal notes.
8. End with a next-skill recommendation based on the dossier findings.

## Evidence Boundaries

The dossier is for public and professional presence: profiles, posts, articles, talks, podcasts, newsletters, repos, product docs, public company pages, and owner-provided exports the user chooses to include.

Do not include private repo planning context, private messages, private contacts, unpublished strategy notes, credentials, sensitive account data, or unrelated personal information in the public dossier. If the user explicitly wants internal planning context captured, place it in a clearly labeled internal notes section and mark the source boundary.

When evidence contains sensitive or mixed public/private material, ask the user to redact or exclude the private material before analysis. Do not infer private facts from public artifacts.

## LinkedIn Evidence Handling

LinkedIn evidence must come from user-provided or public-safe sources only:

- Owner-provided LinkedIn exports.
- Profile snapshots supplied by the user.
- Public unauthenticated profile or company page captures.
- User-provided post, share, article, newsletter, rich media, recommendation, skill, position, education, certification, or company page snapshots.
- User-provided admin or analytics exports only when the user explicitly says they are authorized to share them.

Do not collect LinkedIn evidence through logged-in scraping, bot-protection bypass, paywall access, access-control circumvention, paid API dependency, private-data collection, or private relationship graph extraction.

Before synthesis, classify every LinkedIn source in the evidence register as one of:

- `public`: public profile, public company page, public post/share/article, public recommendation, public rich media, or public career milestone.
- `owner-provided`: owner export, profile snapshot, post/article snapshot, recommendation snapshot, skills export, positions export, education export, or authorized analytics/admin export.
- `admin-provided`: company/page analytics or admin material supplied by an authorized owner/admin.
- `internal notes`: private repo notes the user explicitly asks to preserve outside the public dossier.
- `mixed/redaction needed`: any source containing private contacts, private messages, relationship data, sensitive account data, unrelated personal information, confidential employer/customer material, or a mix of public and private fields.

For `mixed/redaction needed` LinkedIn evidence, stop before synthesis and ask the user for a redacted version or permission to exclude the private fields. If the user has already provided a redacted extract, cite only the redacted path and record the excluded fields as evidence gaps. Never summarize private contacts, private messages, relationship data, or unrelated personal information into the public dossier.

## Source Types

Support these source families when evidence is present:

- LinkedIn personal profiles, company pages, exports, posts, articles, recommendations, and manual/public snapshots.
- Personal websites, blogs, portfolios, public bios, RSS feeds, and sitemaps.
- GitHub profiles, public repos, contribution evidence, READMEs, releases, and product proof.
- Podcasts, interviews, guest appearances, show pages, feeds, and transcripts when available.
- Talks, slide decks, event pages, conference bios, and video descriptions.
- Newsletters, public archives, owner exports, and subscriber or performance notes when owner-provided.
- Product docs, launch notes, case studies, changelogs, public company pages, and customer-facing proof assets.

## Output Requirements

Create the `research/creator-presence/` directory if it does not exist.

`research/creator-presence/<slug>.md` must contain:

- Scope, capture date, and source assumptions.
- Identity.
- Current public promise.
- Career timeline.
- Platform map.
- Core themes.
- Expertise claims.
- Proof assets.
- Signature formats.
- Audience/community signals.
- Product/company connections.
- Gaps, contradictions, and stale positioning.
- Evidence register.
- Next collection tasks.
- Recommended next skills.

Do not invent missing metrics, private context, career milestones, content bodies, transcripts, or audience signals. Record missing fields as evidence gaps.

## Markdown Contract

Use these sections in the dossier, keeping unsupported sections brief with explicit evidence gaps rather than omitting them:

1. `# <Creator or Project Name> Presence Dossier`
2. `## Scope and Capture`
   - Creator or project slug.
   - Capture date.
   - Source assumptions.
   - Included platforms and excluded platforms.
   - Public/professional boundary summary.
3. `## Identity`
   - Public names, roles, affiliations, locations only when publicly stated, and canonical profile links.
   - Distinguish confirmed identity facts from inferred identity signals.
4. `## Current Public Promise`
   - The creator's current public positioning, promise, audience, and category.
   - Confidence and evidence gaps for each claim.
5. `## Career Timeline`
   - Chronological public milestones, roles, launches, talks, publications, repos, and product/company events.
   - Include dates or date ranges when available; mark undated items as gaps.
6. `## Platform Map`
   - Platform, handle or URL, role of the platform, activity state, evidence coverage, and collection gaps.
   - Support LinkedIn, personal websites/blogs, GitHub, podcasts, talks, newsletters, and product docs when evidence is present.
   - For LinkedIn, distinguish personal profile, company page, posts/shares, articles/newsletters, recommendations, skills, positions, education, rich media, and owner/admin-provided analytics when present.
7. `## Core Themes`
   - Recurring subjects, categories, language patterns, and audience problems.
8. `## Expertise Claims`
   - Claimed expertise, evidence supporting each claim, confidence, and missing proof.
9. `## Proof Assets`
   - Public artifacts that substantiate credibility: posts, articles, repos, talks, case studies, product docs, launches, testimonials, podcasts, newsletters, and public metrics.
10. `## Signature Formats`
    - Repeated formats, hooks, series, talk structures, newsletter styles, repo/doc formats, and content patterns.
11. `## Audience and Community Signals`
    - Public engagement signals, community roles, collaborator signals, comments, testimonials, recommendations, event participation, and owner-provided metrics.
    - LinkedIn recommendations, reactions, comments, follower counts, impressions, or company/page analytics may appear only when they are public, owner-provided, admin-provided, or already redacted.
12. `## Product and Company Connections`
    - Companies, products, docs, launches, customer proof, open-source projects, and founder/operator narratives tied to the creator.
13. `## Gaps, Contradictions, and Stale Positioning`
    - Missing evidence, outdated profiles, contradictory claims, unsupported metrics, stale bios, unclear role changes, and collection risks.
14. `## Evidence Register`
    - A table with one row per material source.
15. `## Next Collection Tasks`
    - Prioritized tasks to close evidence gaps, with target platform, collection method, owner, and reason.
16. `## Recommended Next Skills`
    - The next creator-media skills to run and why, using the routing rules below.

## Evidence Register

Every material source must appear in the evidence register. Each row must include:

- `Source path or URL`: repo path, raw evidence path, normalized evidence path, or public URL.
- `Capture date`: the date the source was collected or last verified; use `unknown` only when the date is unavailable and record that as a gap.
- `Source family`: LinkedIn, personal website/blog, GitHub, podcast, talk, newsletter, product docs, YouTube, owner export, or other.
- `Public/private boundary`: `public`, `owner-provided`, `internal notes`, or `mixed/redaction needed`.
- `Confidence level`: `high`, `medium`, or `low`.
- `Claims supported`: the dossier claims this source supports.
- `Evidence gaps`: missing dates, missing body text, unavailable metrics, stale captures, missing transcripts, unclear attribution, or private material that must be excluded.

For LinkedIn rows, `Claims supported` should identify the specific evidence kind when relevant: profile export, profile snapshot, post/share, article/newsletter, rich media, recommendation, skill, position, education, certification, company page, public snapshot, owner-provided analytics, or admin-provided analytics.

Use confidence levels consistently:

- `high`: primary public source, owner-provided export, or directly captured artifact with a capture date.
- `medium`: secondary public source, partial capture, or credible source with incomplete metadata.
- `low`: inferred signal, stale capture, ambiguous attribution, or source with unresolved gaps.

## Approved Artifact Handoff

After an approved synthesized write, explicit write/update mode, or any direct artifact mutation:

- List every created or updated synthesized artifact path in the final response.
- State the verification performed, such as readback, schema/check command, or why no executable verification applies for a Markdown-only strategy artifact.
- Check and report the relevant git status for intended artifacts when the project is a git repository. If intended artifacts are modified or untracked, make the next action shipping, committing, or an explicit dirty-artifact handoff before recommending downstream strategy work.
- Do not imply the research workflow is complete while approved artifacts remain untracked or uncommitted unless the user explicitly asked not to ship.
- If stopping for approval before writing, the approval request remains the next action; do not include downstream routing.

## Intent-Aware Routing

Before applying the default `## Next-Skill Routing` sequence, classify the user's immediate intent and route to the missing action that best serves that intent:

- Strategy refresh: recommend the missing or stale positioning, programming, portfolio, metrics, or product-media artifact.
- Recording prep: recommend the missing series spec, script, build proof, walkthrough guide, or validation artifact needed before recording.
- Upload prep: recommend packaging, title/thumbnail, description, chapters, or final metadata work before broader strategy work.
- Performance review: recommend metrics, cadence, portfolio, peer benchmark, or owner-analytics export work before new content planning.
- Owner analytics or private/manual platform evidence: route to an explicit manual/guide handoff instead of inventing unavailable metrics.
- Dirty intended artifacts: route to shipping/commit/handoff first, not another creator strategy skill.

Use the default next-skill sequence only when no stronger user intent, missing artifact, manual blocker, or dirty-artifact handoff applies.

## Alignment Page

Follow the shared Alignment Page convention in CLAUDE.md. Output: `alignment/creator-presence-dossier-{topic}.html`.

## Constraints

- Do not mutate external accounts or publish content.
- Do not bypass bot protections, rate limits, paywalls, login walls, or access controls.
- Do not require paid APIs, privileged platform programs, or logged-in scraping.
- Do not treat missing metrics, missing bodies, or unavailable transcripts as failures; record them as evidence gaps.
- Cite source paths, source URLs, capture dates, and confidence levels for substantive claims.
