# Report Website

Invoke as `$report-website`.

Use this skill when the user wants one report, a directory of reports, or all documented Markdown outputs turned into a frontend website whose content is represented as clean JSX components instead of a raw Markdown render. The goal is a readable publication surface: strong hierarchy, responsive layout, accessible content, source-faithful report sections, and stable routes for each document.

## Modes

- **Single report**: `$report-website path/to/report.md [route]` converts one Markdown report into one JSX-backed route.
- **Directory**: `$report-website path/to/reports/ [base route]` converts Markdown files under a directory into an index route plus one route per document.
- **All documented outputs**: `$report-website --all-output-docs [base route]` discovers documented output Markdown files across the repo and converts them into a route-based report collection.

## Process

1. **Resolve source and target**
   - Read the requested Markdown report path, directory, or `--all-output-docs` mode. If no path was provided, locate likely report files under `reports/`, `docs/`, `research/`, `benchmark/`, or the project root and ask only when there is no clear source.
   - For `--all-output-docs`, discover tracked Markdown files that are documented outputs rather than operational instructions. Prefer `reports/`, `docs/reports/`, `research/**/reports/`, `benchmark/test-*.md`, `benchmark/review-*.md`, `benchmark/triage-*.md`, `specs/*.md`, and project-specific output folders. Exclude `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SKILL.md`, `PACK.md`, changelog/history/task planning files, dependency docs, and generated assets unless the user explicitly includes them.
   - For directory mode, include Markdown descendants by default, but apply the same exclusions for instruction/config docs unless the directory itself is clearly a report archive.
   - Identify the frontend stack from existing files before creating anything: framework, route conventions, component directories, styling system, icon library, image handling, deployment config, and test commands.
   - Decide the frontend target before writing code:
     - Integrate into an existing frontend app by default when exactly one obvious public/docs/showcase app exists, when an app already owns report-like content, or when an existing app has clear routing, styling, and deploy conventions for documentation pages.
     - In a monorepo, prefer likely documentation/public surfaces by name and evidence: `apps/docs`, `apps/showcase`, `apps/web`, `apps/site`, a separate public report/showcase repository, or routes/components that already render docs, reports, changelogs, or benchmark evidence.
     - Create a separate frontend subdirectory or standalone site only when no frontend app exists, when the user explicitly asks for a standalone site, when the report site needs a separate brand/domain/audience/access policy, or when existing apps cannot cleanly support static report routes.
     - Ask one narrow question before choosing only when multiple plausible frontend apps exist with no clear owner, integrating would change public navigation or deployment in a non-obvious way, the desired base route conflicts with existing routes, or the audience/access level cannot be inferred.
     - When asking, name the concrete candidates and default recommendation, for example: `I found apps/docs and apps/marketing. Should report routes live under apps/docs at /reports, or should I create a standalone report site?`
   - Choose a base route for multi-document mode, such as `/reports`, `/research`, `/benchmarks`, or the user-provided route.
   - Check existing routes before finalizing the base route. If the requested route conflicts, either nest under a non-conflicting route or ask the user to choose between the concrete options.
   - Inspect `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, package scripts, and relevant neighboring pages before editing.

2. **Build the route plan**
   - For single-report mode, create or update one route for the report.
   - For multi-document mode, create:
     - An index route at the base route with searchable or scannable links to every generated document route.
     - One stable route per Markdown file, split by document rather than putting every report on one page.
   - Derive slugs from repo-relative file paths, not just titles, so routes are stable and collisions are rare. Example: `benchmark/test-roadmap-2026-05-17.md` can become `/reports/benchmark/test-roadmap-2026-05-17`.
   - Preserve directory hierarchy when it helps users browse the collection. Flatten only when the target app's route conventions require it.
   - Detect duplicate slugs before writing. Resolve collisions deterministically by adding the nearest parent directory or a short content hash.
   - Generate route metadata for each document: title, source path, last known date if present, category, summary excerpt, and table-of-contents anchors.

3. **Parse reports into structure**
   - Convert each Markdown file into an explicit content model before writing JSX: title, subtitle, metadata, summary, sections, subsections, tables, lists, callouts, citations, figures, links, code blocks, footnotes, and appendices.
   - Preserve source meaning and ordering. Do not summarize, omit, or rewrite findings unless the user explicitly asks for editorial compression.
   - Normalize links, anchors, heading IDs, dates, numbers, and table columns. Keep citations and source references visible and clickable when present.
   - Convert links between included Markdown files into links to their generated routes when possible.
   - Flag unsupported Markdown features or missing assets early, then implement the closest source-faithful rendering.

4. **Build clean JSX**
   - Represent each report with typed data, small presentational components, or a straightforward JSX section tree, following the existing framework's conventions.
   - Keep JSX readable: semantic elements, named section components, stable keys, and clear component boundaries. Avoid a single monolithic blob when the report has meaningful structure.
   - Reuse the same report layout and content components across routes. Do not duplicate large component definitions inside every generated page.
   - For route-based frameworks, use native dynamic/static route generation where appropriate, such as `generateStaticParams`, file-based route segments, or route data loaders.
   - Use framework-native routing, metadata, bundling, and asset APIs. Do not add dependencies unless the existing stack cannot reasonably handle the conversion.
   - Escape or encode content safely. Never inject raw HTML from Markdown unless the project already has a trusted sanitizer and the source requires it.
   - Preserve code blocks, tables, quotes, and footnotes with accessible markup and responsive overflow behavior.

5. **Design the reading experience**
   - Build the actual report as the first screen; do not create a marketing landing page for the report.
   - In multi-document mode, make the base route a useful collection index: group by folder/category/date when available, show source paths or labels, and provide enough context to choose a report.
   - Provide a publication-quality layout with readable measure, strong heading hierarchy, scan-friendly section spacing, and mobile-first responsiveness.
   - Add expected report navigation when the document is long: table of contents, anchor links, sticky or collapsible section nav, progress affordance, or back-to-top controls as appropriate to the existing app.
   - Use the project's design system and UI primitives. If none exist, keep the palette restrained, text-forward, accessible, and not dominated by a single hue family.
   - For report assets, use real supplied images/charts/tables when available. Do not replace report evidence with decorative stock imagery.

6. **Verify behavior and fidelity**
   - Run the repo's relevant lint, typecheck, unit, or build commands.
   - Start the local dev server when needed and inspect the page in a browser at desktop and mobile widths.
   - In multi-document mode, verify the index route and a representative sample of generated document routes across short reports, long reports, tables, code blocks, and nested headings.
   - Check that all sections render, long tables and code blocks do not overflow incoherently, anchors work, generated route links are valid, and text does not overlap.
   - Compare rendered pages against the Markdown sources for missing headings, tables, figures, links, and appendix content. For large batches, run a scripted parity check for document count, heading count, route count, and broken route links.
   - Capture screenshots or describe browser verification evidence in the final response.

7. **Document and ship**
   - Record the source Markdown path or discovery query, generated base route, per-document route strategy, document count, verification commands, and any fidelity exceptions.
   - If tracked files changed, commit and push intended changes on the repository primary branch unless the user explicitly asked not to.
   - Leave unrelated dirty files untouched.

## Output

- **Source:** Markdown report path, directory, or `--all-output-docs` discovery scope used.
- **Website:** base route, index route, and document routes created or updated.
- **Implementation:** key components/data files created or changed.
- **Route Plan:** slug strategy, route count, and collision handling.
- **Fidelity:** any report content intentionally transformed, deferred, or unsupported.
- **Validation:** commands and browser checks run.
- **Git:** commit hash and pushed branch when tracked files changed.
- **Next Work:** exact follow-up, or `none` only when there is no useful follow-up.

## Constraints

- Do not use raw Markdown rendering as the final implementation when the user asked for clean JSX. Markdown may be an intermediate parsing source only.
- Do not collapse multiple documented outputs into one giant page when route-based output is expected. Use an index route plus one route per document.
- Do not create a separate frontend app just because reports are numerous. Prefer integrating into the existing documentation/public site unless the target-selection rules justify separation.
- Do not invent report findings, citations, images, charts, or metrics.
- Do not hide dense report content behind decorative cards, carousels, or marketing sections.
- Do not introduce a new frontend framework inside an existing app unless the user explicitly requests a separate standalone site.
- Do not add broad dependencies for Markdown parsing or UI when the existing project or standard toolchain is sufficient.
- Keep generated JSX maintainable enough for a human to edit the report after conversion.
- Do not skip visual verification for a frontend website.


## Briefing Slides Review Surface

Follow the shared briefing-slides convention via the packaged convention resolver. When this skill creates or amends a dense review artifact, keep building and updating the dense `alignment/*.html` and/or `interrogation/*.html` pages exactly as this skill already requires. Also build or update `briefing-slides/report-website-{topic}.html` as the primary human review UI.

Treat the briefing slide deck as the artifact to open for review. Link the dense pages, source documents, and any other context artifacts from slide reference chips or other clickable slide elements so reviewers can drill into detail without losing the slide-first review flow.

The compiled deck YAML must route back to `$report-website`. Include the dense review pages and source artifacts in `reference_pages` / `source_artifacts`, preserve unanswered gates and slide feedback, and only mark the deck ready when the slide gates are approved.

After artifact creation or amendment, attempt to open only the briefing slide deck. Do not auto-open the linked dense pages.
## Alignment Page

Follow the shared alignment-page convention via the packaged convention resolver; output path is `alignment/report-website-{topic}.html`.

## Default Shipping Contract

- **Default next-step routing:** when reporting completion, include either `Recommended next skill: <command>` or the two-line pair `**Next work:** <specific task or "none">` and `**Recommended next command:** <one command or route>`.
- After building the report website, recommend `$uat` when the report is intended for stakeholder review, or `$ship` when implementation is complete but not yet packaged.
- If this skill creates or modifies tracked repository files, finish by committing and pushing all intended changes to the repository primary branch (`main` when present, otherwise `master`) before stopping.
