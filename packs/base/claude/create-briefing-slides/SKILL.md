description: Create or amend a self-contained PowerPoint-like HTML briefing slide deck for alignment pages, interrogation questions, research findings, framework/workshop artifacts, specs, reports, or documentation plans. Use when Claude should make review material more visual and navigable while preserving dense alignment/interrogation pages and source documents as linked references instead of auto-opening them.

# Create Briefing Slides

Invoke as `/create-briefing-slides`.

Create a self-contained HTML slide deck that becomes the primary opened review surface for dense research, interrogation, alignment, framework, workshop, spec, report, or documentation-creation artifacts. Follow the shared briefing-slides convention via the packaged convention resolver: source checkouts load `docs/briefing-slides-convention.md`, and packaged installs load `assets/briefing-slides-convention.md`.

**Briefing-first review surface (canary).** On the canary lane, this is the review surface producing skills adopt at each interrogation and alignment step. Because this skill's `briefing-slides` convention is canary-only, its presence is the lane signal: where it is installed, a producing skill first authors its dense `interrogation/*.html` / `alignment/*.html` page inline (via the shared interrogation-page / alignment-page conventions), then builds a `briefing-slides/<skill>-<topic>.html` deck as the **primary** review surface, **auto-opens only the deck**, and links the dense pages/sources as drill-down references. The dense page remains canonical and is the fallback surface. Follow the **Briefing-First Review Surface** and **Gate Parity And Partial Decks** sections of the convention: the deck's compiled YAML routes back to the producing command with `reference_pages` / `source_artifacts`, preserves unanswered gates and slide feedback, and is marked ready only when every required gate is approved. Where the convention is absent (stable), the dense page stays the primary review surface and no briefing behavior applies.

## Workflow

1. Resolve scope:
   - Default to the current repository.
   - Identify the source artifact(s), owning skill or workflow, topic slug, dense reference pages, and output path.
   - Use `briefing-slides/<owner-or-topic>.html` by default unless the user provides a valid `briefing-slides/*.html` output path.
   - If a dense `alignment/*.html` or `interrogation/*.html` page exists, read it and use it as a linked reference source. If a dense page is expected but missing, create or ask the owning producing skill to create it first.

2. Preserve dense references:
   - Keep traditional dense pages, markdown reports, specs, research notes, framework outputs, and source documents as canonical references.
   - Link references from the deck with relative links.
   - Do not embed dense pages and do not auto-open linked references.

3. Design the deck:
   - Load `docs/briefing-slides-convention.md` or `assets/briefing-slides-convention.md` before authoring the HTML.
   - Choose the relevant deck pattern: alignment briefing, interrogation briefing, framework/workshop briefing, or documentation briefing.
   - Build the required presentation navigation, reference chips, review controls, marking/annotation controls, copy fallback, print CSS, and YAML compiler from the convention.

4. Archive before replacement:
   - Before replacing an existing deck, archive it to `docs/history/archive/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS/briefing-slides/<filename>.html`.
   - Highlight what changed in the updated deck when amending after feedback.

5. Verify and open:
   - Run the convention's verification checklist.
   - Attempt to open only the deck, using the packaged HTML opener command specified by the convention.
   - Report opener status exactly as `focused`, `opened`, `fallback-opened`, `blocked`, or `failed`.

6. Manifest-driven skill decks (this repo only):
   - The per-skill AFPS deck gallery under `briefing-slides/` is **generated**, not hand-authored. Its source of truth is `briefing-slides/_deck-manifest.json`; edit that manifest to change deck content and regenerate — never hand-edit a generated deck.
   - Regenerate with `node scripts/generate-briefing-decks.mjs` (no-arg = full batch of every manifest deck plus the overviews deck and index; `--deck <slug>`, `--gallery`, `--flagships`, `--manifest`/`--batch`, `--audit-variety` target subsets), then audit with `node scripts/audit-briefing-slides.mjs`.
   - Each deck's six content beats map to rotating archetypes so the folder reads as varied rather than uniform; the bespoke flagship decks (`idea-scope-brief`, `create-briefing-slides`, `release-lane-change-boundary`) stay out of the manifest. See the convention's **Manifest-Driven Skill Decks** section.

## Output

Report:

- Slide deck path.
- Dense reference paths.
- Owning command used in compiled YAML.
- Archive path when a deck was replaced.
- Verification performed.
- Browser-open status for the slide deck.
- Next review action.

## Constraints

- Do not open dense alignment pages, interrogation pages, markdown reports, specs, or references automatically.
- Do not delete or replace dense pages with the slide deck.
- Do not create or modify GitHub Actions workflows.
- Do not write outside the target repository.

## Briefing Slides Convention

Follow the shared briefing-slides convention via the packaged convention resolver. Source checkouts load `docs/briefing-slides-convention.md`; packaged installs load `assets/briefing-slides-convention.md`.

## Default Shipping Contract

- Generated decks, archive copies, and source artifacts are normal repo artifacts. Follow the target repo's shipping rules after verification.
- When operating in this `agentic-skills` repository, follow `docs/github-delivery-contract.md` and publish intended tracked changes through an issue-backed non-primary branch and ready pull request unless the user explicitly says not to ship.
