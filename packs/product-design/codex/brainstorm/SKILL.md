# Brainstorm

Invoke as `$brainstorm`.

Evaluate the current codebase and generate actionable suggestions that the user can take into `$feature-interview` for human/agent alignment, planning-destination triage, and follow-up specification or roadmap work.

This skill runs a three-stage flow by default: a **stage-zero HTML interrogation loop** elicits the ideation frame, then the agent generates the idea set, then an **always-on HTML alignment page** presents that idea set as a review/approval hub with a copyable `$feature-interview` handoff per idea. Writing the legacy `tasks/ideas.md` dump is opt-in (`--dump` flag plus the alignment page's artifact-destination gate).

Pass `--quick` to skip the interrogation loop and the alignment page entirely and run the legacy lightweight path: light terminal scoping, inline suggestions grouped by effort, and a direct append to `tasks/ideas.md`. See `## Quick Mode (--quick)`.

## Follow-up Skill Availability Gate

Before listing any `$feature-interview` prompts, verify that `feature-interview` is available through at least one of these signals:

- `.agents/project.json` has `enabled_skills.feature-interview`.
- `.agents/project.json` has an enabled pack that provides `feature-interview`; use `scripts/pack.sh which feature-interview` when available to identify the provider.
- A local or global skill file exists, such as `.codex/skills/feature-interview/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/feature-interview/SKILL.md`, `~/.codex/skills/feature-interview/SKILL.md`, or `~/.claude/skills/feature-interview/SKILL.md`.

If `feature-interview` is unavailable, the first line of the displayed output and the first line appended for this run in `tasks/ideas.md` must be:

```bash
npx skillpacks install feature-interview
```

Then tell Codex users to start a fresh Codex CLI session if `$feature-interview` remains unavailable after install. Put this prerequisite before any brainstorm suggestion or `$feature-interview <topic>` prompt.

## Process

### 0. Product-Path Scope Resolution

Resolve research scope by product path before using code or app structure as a hint:

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` names a non-archived `research/{slug}/` directory or a product-path ID whose `scope_path` points there, use that path. Treat `{slug}` as the product/app name, not the ICP, audience, or segment label.
2. If `$ARGUMENTS` names only `research/_archive/{slug}/` or a manifest entry with `status: archived` or legacy `status: abandoned`, stop and warn that the path is archived; do not write or update scoped outputs there.
3. Read `research/.progress.yaml` when present. Normalize legacy `active_path` to `active_paths` on read and write back `active_paths` on manifest updates. Treat legacy `abandoned` as `archived`; exclude `archived`, `abandoned`, `deferred`, `revisit_candidate`, `promoted`, and any `scope_path` under `research/_archive/` from active target selection.
4. If active product paths exist in the manifest, use those paths. If multiple active paths exist, ask which one to target unless this skill explicitly supports cross-path output.
5. If no active manifest target exists, list non-archived product directories under `research/`, excluding `research/_archive/` and dot directories. Auto-select only when exactly one exists; ask when multiple exist.
6. If no product directories exist, use flat `research/` single-product mode.
7. Detect monorepo/app/package structure only as a secondary hint. Suggest creating a missing `research/{slug}/` product path when code clearly exposes an app, but do not require code or monorepo detection before using `research/{slug}/`.

When product path `{slug}` is active, read and write research under `research/{slug}/`, specs under `specs/{slug}/`, and treat top-level `research/*.md` files as flat-mode documents or cross-path summaries.

1. Read CLAUDE.md, README, package config, and key source files to understand the project.
2. Check `tasks/roadmap.md`, `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/manual-todo.md`, `tasks/record-todo.md`, `tasks/recurring-todo.md` (when they exist), and specs from `specs/` (or `spec.md`) if they exist — avoid suggesting things already planned or deferred as advisory records. Read `research/competitive-analysis.md` (or `research/{slug}/competitive-analysis.md`) if it exists — competitor gaps, market white space, and positioning weaknesses are high-signal inputs for ideation. Read `research/customer-feedback.md` (or `research/{slug}/customer-feedback.md`) if it exists — "Wrong" and "New" findings are highest-signal ideation input. Read `research/metrics.md` (or `research/{slug}/metrics.md`) if it exists — instrumentation gaps can generate ideas.

### Stage-zero interrogation loop

Unless `--quick` is set (see `## Quick Mode (--quick)`), run this loop. This skill **cannot generate the idea set until the confidence gate passes.** Before brainstorming, elicit the ideation frame in HTML interrogation rounds (see `## Interrogation Page` / `INTERROGATION-PAGE.md` in this skill's directory). Terminal questioning is the degraded fallback only when an HTML page cannot be opened.

- **Round 1 — Ideation Frame Manifest.** Present what you think the project is and how you intend to brainstorm it, as confirm/correct/flag controls in `interrogation/brainstorm-r1-{branch}.html`, alongside the first genuinely open questions (each marked `data-open-input`) placed only where no assumption is derivable. Tag each assumption `[from prompt]`, `[from repo]`, `[from research]`, `[from codebase]`, or `[inferred]`. Cover: project identity and current state; the ideation focus and which dimensions are in or out of scope (strategic/product, improvement, hygiene, market-fit); effort and risk appetite and horizon constraints; areas explicitly off-limits and hard non-goals; what counts as a high-value idea for this project; the target audience or product-path scope; and the riskiest assumptions about where the opportunity lies. Set `data-interrogation-round="1"`, `data-interrogation-gate="continue"`, and the answer sidecar `research/_working/interrogation-brainstorm-r1.yaml` (or `research/{slug}/_working/interrogation-brainstorm-r1.yaml` in product-path mode), open the page, and stop for the compiled round YAML.
- **Rounds 2..N — adaptive follow-ups.** Seed each round from the prior round's compiled answers: drill into corrections, resolve contradictions, and cover any frame area still open. Do not re-ask settled items.
- **Confidence gate / coverage checkpoint.** When every frame area is covered or explicitly waived, set `data-interrogation-gate="coverage-checkpoint"`, render the coverage checkpoint, and advance to idea generation. If the user flags a gap, raise the round number and continue.

Only after the confidence gate passes, analyse the codebase across these dimensions, scoped by the elicited ideation frame:

   **Strategic / Product**
   - New features that would make the project significantly more useful or valuable
   - New workflows or end-to-end automation the project could enable
   - Product line expansion — adjacent use cases, new audiences, or complementary products the core could serve
   - Integration opportunities with external tools, platforms, or APIs that multiply value

   **Improvement**
   - Missing capabilities the architecture is set up for
   - Pain points, rough edges, or manual steps that could be automated
   - Performance bottlenecks or low-hanging optimisations
   - Developer experience friction

   **Hygiene**
   - Technical debt where code has outgrown its design
   - Testing gaps in critical paths
   - Security hardening opportunities

   **Market Fit** (only when `research/icp.md` (or `research/{slug}/icp.md`), `research/mvp-gap.md` (or `research/{slug}/mvp-gap.md`), or `research/competitive-analysis.md` (or `research/{slug}/competitive-analysis.md`) exist)
   - ICP alignment — features addressing ICP pain points that are missing or incomplete
   - Journey gaps — steps where the product loses the user or customer
   - Unaddressed MVP gaps from `research/mvp-gap.md` (or `research/{slug}/mvp-gap.md`) not yet in roadmap
   - Competitive white space — features or capabilities no competitor offers well, from `research/competitive-analysis.md` (or `research/{slug}/competitive-analysis.md`) market gaps
   - Competitor leapfrog — specific competitor weaknesses to exploit, or table-stakes features competitors have that you lack
   - Positioning plays — ideas that sharpen differentiation against the competitive landscape
A focus area in `$ARGUMENTS` (anything other than the `--dump` flag and a product-path slug) narrows the dimensions to that area; otherwise cover all dimensions. The elicited frame from the interrogation loop always takes precedence over the raw argument.

### Build the alignment page

Unless `--quick` is set (see `## Quick Mode (--quick)`), this step is **always-on**: after the idea set is generated, present it in the alignment page at `alignment/brainstorm-{topic}.html`, following `ALIGNMENT-PAGE.md` in this skill's directory. The page is the durable hub; do not treat a chat dump as the primary surface.

The page is structured as a review/approval hub:

- **Idea cards grouped by effort** (hours / days / weeks). Each card carries a specific actionable title, a one-line description with the concrete codebase signal (file, pattern, or metric) that motivates it, and a copyable per-idea handoff: the `$feature-interview <topic>` prompt plus a separate copy button for the additional context to paste alongside it.
- **Review gates** for the idea set: per-idea approve/reject/flag controls so the user can curate which ideas survive, plus a coverage checkpoint confirming the brainstorm covered the elicited frame.
- **Artifact-destination gate.** Confirm whether the approved ideas are also appended to `tasks/ideas.md`. `--dump` in `$ARGUMENTS` pre-sets the intent; the gate is the final confirmation. Default is no dump.
- **On approval (confirmed-page write step).** Persist the curated idea set into the page. Only when `--dump` is set and the destination gate approves (or the user selects the dump option at the gate) append the approved ideas to `tasks/ideas.md` — do not overwrite existing content. When product-path scope is active, prefix each suggestion with the app name. Keep the page open afterward as a working hub: the user copies each idea's `$feature-interview <topic>` prompt and its additional context into `$feature-interview` one at a time.

## Output

The **alignment page** (`alignment/brainstorm-{topic}.html`) is the primary, durable artifact — the idea set, its motivating evidence, the review gates, and the per-idea `$feature-interview` handoffs all live there. Keep it open after confirmation as a working hub: copy each idea's `$feature-interview <topic>` prompt and its additional context into `$feature-interview` one at a time.

Writing the legacy `tasks/ideas.md` dump is **opt-in**, controlled in two layers that must agree before the file is written:
- **Flag:** `--dump` in `$ARGUMENTS` pre-sets the intent to also append the approved ideas to `tasks/ideas.md`.
- **Gate:** the alignment page's artifact-destination gate confirms the `tasks/ideas.md` write at approval time. Default is no dump.

Only when `--dump` is set and the destination gate approves it (or the user selects the dump option at that gate) append the approved idea set to `tasks/ideas.md` during the confirmed-page write step — do not overwrite existing content. When product-path scope is active, prefix each suggestion with the app name.

Each idea — rendered on the page and in any dump — is grouped by effort level (hours / days / weeks) and includes:
- A specific, actionable title
- A one-line description with the concrete codebase signal that motivates it
- The `$feature-interview <topic>` prompt plus the additional context to paste alongside it

## Constraints

- Be specific and actionable — no vague aspirations.
- Limit to 3–5 suggestions per effort level.
- Do not suggest changes that conflict with CLAUDE.md conventions.
- Do not repeat work already in `tasks/roadmap.md`, `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/manual-todo.md`, `tasks/record-todo.md`, `tasks/recurring-todo.md`, or `specs/` (or `specs/{slug}/`).

## Interrogation Page

Before producing research, run the stage-zero interrogation loop following `INTERROGATION-PAGE.md` in this skill's directory. Build one HTML page per round at `interrogation/brainstorm-r{N}-{branch}.html`, starting with the assumptions manifest as round 1, and loop until the confidence gate passes. This skill **cannot advance to stage one until** the confidence gate passes with at least one completed interrogation round and every interview area covered or waived. Each round page must contain at least one genuinely open input (`data-open-input`).

## Quick Mode (--quick)

When `--quick` is present in `$ARGUMENTS`, skip the stage-zero interrogation loop and the alignment page entirely and run the legacy lightweight path:

1. **Light scoping.** If a focus area is already supplied in `$ARGUMENTS`, skip straight to analysis. Otherwise optionally ask 1–3 light scoping questions with `request_user_input` (ideation focus, effort/risk appetite, off-limits areas) — no HTML, no confidence gate.
2. **Analyse the same dimensions** as the idea-generation step above, scoped by the focus area or the light answers.
3. **Output suggestions inline**, grouped by effort level (hours / days / weeks). Each suggestion carries its specific actionable title, the concrete codebase signal (file, pattern, or metric) that motivates it, and the `$feature-interview <topic>` prompt to copy.
4. **Append directly to `tasks/ideas.md`** — do not overwrite existing content. When product-path scope is active, prefix each suggestion with the app name. There is no artifact-destination gate in quick mode; `--dump` is implied and redundant.

Still honor the `## Follow-up Skill Availability Gate`: if `feature-interview` is unavailable, the install prerequisite leads both the inline output and the `tasks/ideas.md` append.
