# Build UI Screens

Invoke as `/build-ui-screens`.

Build the visual UI screens for one approved UI branch. Use this skill after `/ui-interview [specific-ux-variation]` approves a UI experiment branch and the branch needs concrete screens before the clickable, state-backed prototype exists. This is the visual half of the build leaf; `/logic-wiring` is the wiring half that makes these screens reachable and interactive.

This skill builds screens as an **ordered element-batch loop**: one flow step at a time, adding the elements that step needs, pausing at a **per-batch visual checkpoint**, and stopping at the **minimum UI** that lets the flow step read as real. It uses fake, fixture, local, or in-memory data. It must not introduce durable database/storage, auth, payments, analytics, deployment, admin tooling, multi-tenancy, production observability, or other production infrastructure — that wiring belongs to `/logic-wiring` and later production planning.

Follow `DESIGN-TREE-LOOP.md` for design-tree routing, state storage, branch decisions, approval boundaries, and task classification. UI experiment branch state belongs in `design/**/flow-tree-*.yaml`, not `tasks/todo.md`.

## Gate

Before building, verify the approved branch is explicit:

- Read `design/**/flow-tree-*.yaml` and resolve the named `ui_experiments[]` branch. If `$ARGUMENTS` is missing, choose the first approved UI experiment branch that has no visual screens yet (no `build_ledger[]` past `minimum-ui-reached` and no `experiment_path`/`review_evidence`), honoring any recorded branch-order override.
- Read the branch packet from `design/ui-[topic].md`, `design/ui-requirements-[topic].md`, or product-path-scoped equivalents.
- Read the parent `design/ux-variations-[topic].md`, `design/user-flow-[topic].md`, and any relevant `design/brainstorm-inspirations-{topic}.md` or `design/take-inspiration-{topic}-*.md` when present.
- Stop if no UI branch has an explicit approve decision. Route back to `/ui-interview [specific-ux-variation]`.
- Stop if the requested work needs production infrastructure. Record the deferred infrastructure and route to prototype evidence first.

## Process

1. **Resolve scope.** Identify the product path, topic, parent user-flow branch, UX variation branch, and approved UI experiment branch. Preserve branch IDs from the flow-tree manifest. Read the batch plan authored by `/ui-interview` when present.
2. **Define the first-value journey.** Name the first-value moment, the primary task path, the entry route, the exit/success state, and the evidence needed before moving deeper.
3. **Choose the screen home.** Prefer a project-native lightweight route when the app already has a safe local experiment surface. Otherwise create a disposable route under `experiments/{topic}/{ui-experiment-id}/`. Keep the screens easy to remove.
4. **Walk the element-batch loop.** Treat each flow step as one batch (`build_ledger[]` entry = one `flow_step`). For each batch, in flow order:
   - Add only the visual elements that flow step needs. Use fake, fixture, local, or in-memory data.
   - Pause at a **per-batch visual checkpoint**: render the screen and confirm it reads as the intended moment before moving to the next batch.
   - Apply the **minimum-UI stop rule**: stop adding elements once the flow step reads as real. Do not over-build secondary controls, alternate states, or dense admin surfaces in this pass.
   - Record the batch in the `ui_experiments[].build_ledger[]` array: `id`, `flow_step`, `elements_added[]`, status `minimum-ui-reached` once the stop rule fires (or `parked` if the batch is deferred out of this pass), and a short `notes`.
5. **Progressive reveal.** Introduce first value and the primary task path before dense secondary controls. Hide, defer, or stub secondary controls until the screens prove the core journey.
6. **Review evidence.** Produce a concise review note naming what the user should look at, what the screens establish, what worked, what remains unknown, and which deferred infrastructure stays out of scope.
7. **Update branch state.** Write the `build_ledger[]` entries and add `experiment_path` and `review_evidence` to the relevant `ui_experiments[]` branch in the flow-tree manifest. Keep `artifacts[]` for canonical design and review files. Do not create or update the prototype build plan from here.
8. **Build the alignment page.** Render the per-batch screens, first-value journey, fake-data boundary, build ledger, deferred infrastructure, and review gate in `alignment/build-ui-screens-{topic}.html`.

## Output

The skill may create or update:

```text
experiments/{topic}/{ui-experiment-id}/
design/**/flow-tree-*.yaml
alignment/build-ui-screens-{topic}.html
```

When using a project-native route instead of `experiments/`, record the exact route path in `experiment_path` and the concise note or repo-relative review artifact in `review_evidence` in the flow-tree manifest and in the alignment page.

## Next Work

After the screens exist and the build ledger is written, choose the next route from filesystem state:

- `/user-flow-map --prototype-build-plan [topic]` is the default next step when no valid prototype build plan exists. Use this when `design/**/prototype-build-plan-*.md` is missing, or when present build-plan artifacts do not include the approved `ui_experiment_id` for the UI experiment just built.
- `/logic-wiring [topic]` may be recommended only when `design/**/prototype-build-plan-*.md` exists and includes the approved `ui_experiment_id` as a build item. This makes the built screens clickable and state-backed by advancing the matching build item and `build_ledger[]` entries from `minimum-ui-reached` to `wired`.
- `/logic-wiring [topic]` may also be used as an explicit untracked ad hoc bypass only when the user knowingly accepts skipping the prototype build-plan ledger for this run. Name that bypass in the handoff and do not imply it is the tracked default.
- `/uat --variant-evaluation` when the screens themselves are being used as the evaluated variant artifact.

**Recommended next command:** `/user-flow-map --prototype-build-plan [topic]`.

If a valid prototype build-plan item already references the approved `ui_experiment_id`, the terminal handoff may instead recommend the resolved `/logic-wiring [topic]` or `/logic-wiring [topic] --variant N` command for that item.

## Invoke With YAML

Emit `agent_routing` only after resolving prototype-build-plan state:

- Missing or invalid build plan: `approved_next_skill: "/user-flow-map --prototype-build-plan [topic]"`.
- Valid build plan with the approved `ui_experiment_id`: set `approved_next_skill` to the resolved wiring command for the matching item, such as `/logic-wiring [topic]` or `/logic-wiring [topic] --variant N`.
- Explicit user-accepted untracked ad hoc bypass: set `approved_next_skill` to the resolved wiring command and include `routing_note: "untracked ad hoc bypass accepted by user; no prototype build-plan item exists"`.

Do not emit an unconditional wiring value in `approved_next_skill` from this skill.

Do not route to production planning, roadmap work, or durable infrastructure until experiment review evidence explicitly promotes the branch.

## Constraints

- Use fake, fixture, local, or in-memory data only.
- Build one approved UI experiment branch per run.
- Build one flow-step batch at a time; stop each batch at the minimum UI that lets the step read as real.
- Use progressive reveal; do not expose dense secondary controls before the primary task path reads.
- Do not wire clickable navigation, state transitions, or runnable logic — that is `/logic-wiring`'s job.
- Do not build production infrastructure, external account integrations, deployment automation, or durable storage.
- Do not skip the review evidence gate before handing off to `/user-flow-map --prototype-build-plan`, `/logic-wiring`, or `/uat --variant-evaluation`.
- Do not route to `/logic-wiring` before the prototype build-plan slice exists and includes the approved `ui_experiment_id`, unless the user explicitly accepts an untracked ad hoc bypass.
- When recommending a skill from another pack, verify the pack is installed via `.agents/project.json` `enabled_packs`. If not installed, recommend `npx skillpacks install <pack-name>` from the project shell before the target skill.


## Briefing Slides Review Surface

Follow the shared briefing-slides convention via the packaged convention resolver. When this skill creates or amends a dense review artifact, keep building and updating the dense `alignment/*.html` and/or `interrogation/*.html` pages exactly as this skill already requires. Also build or update `briefing-slides/build-ui-screens-{topic}.html` as the primary human review UI.

Treat the briefing slide deck as the artifact to open for review. Link the dense pages, source documents, and any other context artifacts from slide reference chips or other clickable slide elements so reviewers can drill into detail without losing the slide-first review flow.

The compiled deck YAML must route back to `/build-ui-screens`. Include the dense review pages and source artifacts in `reference_pages` / `source_artifacts`, preserve unanswered gates and slide feedback, and only mark the deck ready when the slide gates are approved.

After artifact creation or amendment, attempt to open only the briefing slide deck. Do not auto-open the linked dense pages.
## Alignment Page

Follow the shared alignment-page convention via the packaged convention resolver; output path is `alignment/build-ui-screens-{topic}.html`.

The page must show the per-batch screens, first-value journey, primary task path, build ledger, fake-data boundary, deferred infrastructure, review evidence, and the exact downstream handoff gate.
