# Release

Invoke as `$release`.

Use this skill when the user wants to cut a release for the project.

## Process

1. Determine version bump from arguments or analyze commits to suggest one.
2. Run pre-release checks:
   - Ensure the working tree is clean.
   - Resolve the primary branch: prefer `main`; if it does not exist, use `master`. If neither exists, stop and explain the blocker.
   - Ensure the current branch is the primary branch. If not, stop and tell the user to cut releases only from `main`/`master`.
   - Ensure the primary branch is up to date with remote.
   - Run tests to verify everything passes.
3. Generate changelog from conventional commits since last tag.
4. Bump version in package.json and other version files.
5. Commit and create annotated git tag.
6. Ask about push, GitHub release, and deploy.

## Output

- **Changelog**: features, fixes, breaking changes
- **Files Updated**: version files and changelog
- **Tag**: version tag created
- **Next Steps**: awaiting confirmation for push/release/deploy

## Constraints

- Always confirm version with user before changes.
- Never push or create GitHub releases without explicit confirmation.
- **Do not push to an existing feature branch.** Releases should only be cut from `main`/`master`. If on a feature branch, stop and ask the user.
- Stop if tests fail — do not release broken code.


## Alignment Page

By default, this skill reports results inline and writes only its normal durable artifacts (for example `tasks/*.md`, reports, queues, benchmark notes, status docs, or other skill-specific files). Do not build an alignment page automatically. Create `alignment/release-{topic}.html` only when the user explicitly requests an alignment page or when you explicitly identify a concrete clarification/review need that cannot be handled cleanly inline; when you create one, follow `ALIGNMENT-PAGE.md` in this skill's directory.
