# Mono Detect

Use this skill to detect a pnpm workspace monorepo and generate the `.agents/monorepo.json` artifact consumed by the monorepo pack.

`mono-detect` is the foundation skill for `mono-run`, `mono-ship`, and `mono-guard`. Those skills use its output to inject monorepo-aware pre/post steps into the standard `/run` and `/ship` contracts without duplicating the global workflow.

## Augmentation Injection Pattern

`mono-detect` is the pack's detection foundation for the augmentation injection pattern. It does not replace `/run`, `/ship`, or global monorepo planning skills; it supplies `.agents/monorepo.json` so `mono-run`, `mono-ship`, and `mono-guard` can inject monorepo-aware pre-flight and post-integration checks around those existing workflows.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the target repository root.
   - Use `$ARGUMENTS` as the root when provided.
   - Otherwise use the current working directory.
2. Locate the pack script relative to this skill: `../../scripts/mono-detect.sh` from the monorepo pack root.
3. Check whether `.agents/monorepo.json` is fresh:
   - Run `packs/monorepo/scripts/mono-detect.sh <root> --check-stale`.
   - If it prints `fresh: .agents/monorepo.json`, keep the existing artifact.
   - If the file is missing, stale, or the check does not report fresh, run `packs/monorepo/scripts/mono-detect.sh <root>` to regenerate it.
4. If detection fails because `pnpm-workspace.yaml` is missing:
   - Report that the project is not a detected pnpm monorepo.
   - Suggest `/mono-migrate` as a future V2 migration route when the user wants to convert a single-app project.
   - Do not create `.agents/monorepo.json` by hand.
5. Read `.agents/monorepo.json` and summarize:
   - Workspace manager.
   - Build orchestrator (`turborepo` when `turbo.json` is present, otherwise none).
   - Package count and package paths.
   - Internal dependency graph edges.
   - Turborepo pipeline names.
6. Report staleness behavior:
   - Mention that the artifact is regenerated when `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, or workspace `package.json` files are newer than `.agents/monorepo.json`.
7. Route the next step:
   - If detection passed and the user is preparing execution, recommend `/mono-run`.
   - If detection passed and the user is checking lane safety, recommend `/mono-guard`.
   - If detection failed because this is not a pnpm monorepo, recommend `/mono-migrate` as the V2 advisory route.

## Output Format

- **Detection:** detected, fresh, regenerated, or not detected.
- **Workspace:** manager, build orchestrator, root path.
- **Packages:** count plus package name/path list.
- **Dependency graph:** internal dependency edges; say `none` when no internal edges exist.
- **Turbo pipelines:** pipeline names when present; say `none` when Turborepo is absent.
- **Artifact:** `.agents/monorepo.json` path and whether it was reused or regenerated.
- **Next work:** concrete follow-up.
- **Recommended next command:** one command.

## Constraints

- Do not edit task files.
- Do not run package manager install/add commands.
- Do not infer non-pnpm workspace managers in V1.
- Do not modify `.agents/monorepo.json` manually; use `mono-detect.sh`.
- Treat `mono-detect` as an augmentation foundation for `mono-run`, `mono-ship`, and `mono-guard`, not as a replacement for `/run`, `/ship`, or global monorepo planning skills.

## Alignment Page

When this skill produces durable deliverables (research, specs, plans, reports, prototypes, or any document output), build a full-depth HTML alignment page at `alignment/mono-detect-{topic}.html`. Use a normalized topic slug derived from the app, feature, research subject, report subject, or output filename.

**Full content requirement.** The alignment page must contain the complete content of every proposed markdown deliverable -- every section, every finding, every detail, every list item. It is a thorough interactive review document, not a summary. Render the full deliverable content in clean, readable HTML with appropriate hierarchy, styling, and navigation. If the skill writes multiple scoped deliverables in one run, build one alignment page that contains all deliverables with anchor-linked navigation.

**Inline questions.** After each content section that involves a decision, ambiguity, or clarification, place the relevant multiple-choice questions immediately below that section's content, inside a visually distinct question block. Each question must use radio-button inputs and include two standing options after the skill-generated choices: "Other / None of the above" backed by a multi-line text box for free-form input, and "Need clarification" backed by an optional notes box where the user can explain what is unclear. When any radio option other than "Other" or "Need clarification" is selected, show an optional "Additional notes" text box beneath it so the user can qualify their choice. Generate questions based on what genuinely needs user input -- do not add filler questions. Do not create a separate bottom "Decisions & Clarifications" section.

**Answer compilation.** At the bottom of the page, include a "Compile Answers" button that aggregates answers from all inline question blocks throughout the page, including any free-text notes attached to selections. The button: remains disabled until every question has a selection (including "Need clarification" as a valid selection) and shows a count of remaining unanswered questions; when clicked while questions remain unanswered, scrolls the viewport to the first unanswered question instead of compiling; when all questions have a selection, generates a structured YAML block of all Q&A pairs (grouped by the section they belong to, with status — answered / other / needs-clarification — and any notes included) and displays it in a read-only, click-to-copy textarea.

**Diff highlighting on updates.** When the agent updates an existing alignment page after receiving compiled answers, highlight what changed since the previous version. The agent chooses inline annotation or side-by-side layout per situation.

**Archiving.** Before replacing an existing alignment page, archive it to `docs/history/archive/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS/alignment/mono-detect-{topic}.html`.

**Browser open.** Attempt to open the resulting HTML page in the browser and report whether the open succeeded or was blocked. A blocked browser-open attempt does not make the skill fail when the files were written correctly.

## Default Shipping Contract

- **Default next-step routing:** when reporting completion, include the two-line pair `**Next work:** <specific task, blocker, or follow-up>` and `**Recommended next command:** <one command or route>` so the next operator has a concrete handoff.
- If this skill creates or modifies tracked repository files, finish by committing and pushing all intended changes to the repository primary branch (`main` when present, otherwise `master`) before stopping, even if the user did not explicitly ask for commit/push.
- Do not leave tracked changes or unpushed commits behind. If unrelated tracked work is already present, either include it in sensible commits too or stop and explain the blocker.
- This contract does not override stricter safety rules about secrets, destructive history changes, release publication/tag confirmation, or production deploy confirmation.
