# GTM — Go-to-Market Planning

Interview-driven skill that builds a go-to-market plan grounded in ICP research and competitive landscape. Covers channel strategy, messaging framework, pricing, launch plan, and early traction tactics.

## Prerequisites

- **Hard**: `research/icp.md` (or `research/{app}/icp.md` in monorepo mode) must exist. If not, tell the user to run `/icp` first and stop.
- **Soft**: Read `research/competitive-analysis.md` (or `research/{app}/competitive-analysis.md`), `research/journey-map.md` (or `research/{app}/journey-map.md`), `research/customer-feedback.md` (or `research/{app}/customer-feedback.md`) if they exist — these improve specificity but aren't required.

## Process

### 0. App Scope Resolution (Monorepo Support)

Before checking prerequisites, determine the app scope:

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies an app name matching a subdirectory of `research/`, use it.
2. If `research/` contains subdirectories (excluding files), list them and ask the user which app to target. If only one subdirectory exists, use it automatically.
3. If no subdirectories exist, proceed with flat structure (single-product mode).

When app scope `{app}` is active:
- Read/write research from `research/{app}/` instead of `research/`
- Read/write specs from `specs/{app}/` instead of `specs/`
- Also read `research/icp.md` (cross-app overview) for broader context

### 1. Load Context

- Read `research/icp.md` (or `research/{app}/icp.md`) — ICP segments, pain points, value props, trigger events, current-state journey
- Read `research/competitive-analysis.md` (or `research/{app}/competitive-analysis.md`) if it exists — competitor positioning, pricing, channels, market gaps
- Read `research/journey-map.md` (or `research/{app}/journey-map.md`) if it exists — customer journey stages, discovery channels, conversion triggers
- Read `research/customer-feedback.md` (or `research/{app}/customer-feedback.md`) if it exists — real customer language, validated/invalidated assumptions
- Read `research/positioning.md` (or `research/{app}/positioning.md`) if it exists — positioning framework that messaging should flow from
- Read CLAUDE.md and README if they exist — product context

### 2. Interview

Use the AskUserQuestion tool. Ask 1–3 focused questions per turn.

**Research and recommend by default.** For each decision point, use web search, upstream research docs (`research/*.md`), and codebase analysis to gather evidence before asking the user. Present your findings with data, state your recommendation with reasoning, and ask the user to approve, adjust, or override. Only ask the user to choose without a recommendation when the decision genuinely requires insider knowledge they haven't shared (internal constraints, personal preferences, strategic bets).

Cover these areas (skip or abbreviate areas the user has already addressed in `$ARGUMENTS`):

#### A. Channel Strategy
- Where does the ICP hang out? (communities, platforms, events, publications)
- Which channels do competitors use? Where are the gaps?
- What's the primary acquisition channel? (content, community, outbound, product-led, partnerships)
- What's the secondary/backup channel?
- What's the budget and resource constraint? (bootstrapped, funded, team size)

#### B. Messaging Framework
- IF `research/positioning.md` exists: use positioning statement, market category, unique attributes, and value mapping as the foundation for messaging — do not contradict positioning decisions
- What's the one-liner? (the sentence that makes the ICP lean in — should flow from positioning statement)
- What's the primary value prop framing? (save time, save money, reduce risk, unlock capability — should align with positioning value mapping)
- What pain point does the headline address? (from ICP pain map)
- What proof points exist? (metrics, testimonials, case studies, demos)
- How does positioning differ from competitors? (from positioning.md if it exists, otherwise from competitive analysis)

#### C. Pricing Strategy
- What's the pricing model? (freemium, free trial, paid-only, usage-based, seat-based)
- What's the entry price point? What does the ICP currently pay for alternatives?
- What triggers the upgrade? (usage limits, team features, advanced capabilities)
- Are there pricing tiers? What differentiates them?
- How does pricing compare to competitors?

#### D. Launch Plan
- What's the launch timeline? (soft launch, beta, public launch)
- What's the launch channel? (Product Hunt, Hacker News, Twitter, email list, direct outreach)
- What's the launch goal? (signups, revenue, feedback, press)
- What launch assets are needed? (landing page, demo, video, blog post)
- Who are the first 10 customers? (specific names or types)

#### E. Early Traction Tactics
- What's the 30-day post-launch plan?
- What manual/unscalable things will you do? (concierge onboarding, personal outreach, hand-holding)
- What's the feedback loop? (how will you learn from early users?)
- What's the one metric that matters for the first 90 days?
- When do you pivot from manual to scalable?

### 3. Present Findings & Validate

**Present the complete GTM plan to the user before writing.** Summarise with evidence:
1. Channel strategy — primary and secondary channels, with ICP behavior data supporting each choice
2. Messaging framework — one-liner, value prop framing, proof points, citing specific ICP pain points addressed
3. Pricing strategy — model, entry point, tiers, with competitor pricing benchmarks as anchors
4. Launch plan — timeline, channels, goals, assets needed, citing trigger events that inform timing
5. Early traction tactics — 30/60/90 day plan, the one metric that matters, with journey data supporting the traction approach

Use AskUserQuestion to ask:
- "Does this capture your go-to-market strategy? Anything missing or off?"

Continue until the user confirms. Only then proceed to writing.

### 4. Populate Next Steps

Before writing, check which files exist to populate the `## Next Steps` section contextually. Include 3–5 applicable items with "Pick one:" framing:

- IF `specs/` exist and no `tasks/roadmap.md`: `/roadmap` — Plan the build with launch milestones from above
- IF no `research/metrics.md`: `/metrics` — Define success metrics for the launch goals
- IF open questions need research: `/plan-interview [top question]` — Validate the most critical open question
- IF `tasks/roadmap.md` exists: `/run` — Start executing — the GTM plan is set
- IF no `research/journey-map.md`: `/journey-map` — Map the customer journey to validate funnel assumptions
- IF no `research/positioning.md`: `/positioning` — Define strategic positioning — messaging should flow from positioning

**Impact-aware adjustments:**
- IF downstream impact is **Major**: prepend `/reconcile-research — [N] conflicts found in downstream docs` as the first item
- IF downstream impact is **Minor**: annotate relevant skill suggestions with "(stale — [brief description])"

### 5. Write Output

Only after the user has validated the findings, write the output files.

### 6. Downstream Impact Check

After writing, check for downstream research documents that may be affected by what was just decided. Only check documents that exist on disk.

**Downstream documents to check** (use `{app}/` prefix when app scope is active):
- `research/monetization.md`

For each existing downstream document:
1. Read it — focus on `> Based on:` header, `## Summary`, and sections that reference concepts this skill just defined or changed
2. Identify **specific conflicts**: claims, assumptions, or references that contradict what was just decided. Examples:
   - A pricing model reference that contradicts the pricing strategy just defined
   - Channel strategy assumptions that have shifted
   - Launch timeline or traction targets that no longer align
3. Note each conflict: downstream file, section, the stale claim (quote it), and what it should now say

**Classify the impact**:
- **None**: No downstream documents exist, or no conflicts found. Skip display entirely.
- **Minor** (1–2 small conflicts): Display conflicts to user inline.
- **Major** (3+ conflicts OR a foundational assumption changed — e.g., pricing model changed, primary channel shifted, launch timeline moved significantly): Display conflicts and strongly recommend `/reconcile-research`.

Display to the user after showing the written file confirmation. This should be quick — one read per downstream doc, scan for conflicts against key decisions. Not a deep reconciliation.

## Next Steps

Pick one:
- [conditional items from step 4 — only include items whose conditions are met]
```

### `research/gtm-interview.md` (or `research/{app}/gtm-interview.md`)
Raw interview log — questions, options presented, user responses, and a closing summary of key decisions.

Create the `research/` directory if it doesn't exist.

## Constraints

- **Requires ICP.** Cannot build a GTM plan without knowing who you're selling to.
- **Ground in research.** Every channel, message, and pricing decision should trace back to ICP insights, competitive gaps, or customer feedback.
- **Be specific.** "Use social media" is not a channel strategy. "Post weekly technical deep-dives on Twitter targeting DevOps engineers who follow [competitor]" is.
- **Present before writing.** Never write output files until findings have been presented and validated.
- **Don't prescribe product changes.** GTM is about reaching and converting the market with what exists. Product gaps belong in `/mvp-gap` or `/brainstorm`.
- **Do not overwrite existing `research/gtm.md`** (or `research/{app}/gtm.md`) without asking the user first.


## Default Shipping Contract

- If this skill creates or modifies tracked repository files, finish by committing and pushing all intended changes to the repository primary branch (`main` when present, otherwise `master`) before stopping, even if the user did not explicitly ask for commit/push.
- Do not leave tracked changes or unpushed commits behind. If unrelated tracked work is already present, either include it in sensible commits too or stop and explain the blocker.
- This contract does not override stricter safety rules about secrets, destructive history changes, release publication/tag confirmation, or production deploy confirmation.
