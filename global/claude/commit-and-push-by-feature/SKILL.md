# Commit and Push by Feature

Commit and push all changes to GitHub grouped by feature/function.

## Process

1. **Inspect changes:**
   - Run `git status` and `git diff` to understand all changes.

2. **Identify logical buckets:**
   - Group changes into feature/function buckets (e.g., "auth", "api", "ui", "tests", "docs", "build", "refactor"). Prefer 2–6 commits total unless the change set is tiny.

3. **Commit each bucket:**
   - For each bucket:
     - Stage only the files for that bucket (use `git add <paths>`; avoid `git add -A` unless it's the final bucket and everything belongs together).
     - Create a conventional commit message:
       - `feat(<scope>): <summary>` for new functionality
       - `fix(<scope>): <summary>` for bug fixes
       - `refactor(<scope>): <summary>` for refactors without behavior change
       - `test(<scope>): <summary>` for tests only
       - `docs(<scope>): <summary>` for documentation
       - `chore(<scope>): <summary>` for tooling/config
     - Include a short body only if it clarifies intent or risk.
     - Verify `git diff --cached` matches the bucket before committing.
   - If there are uncommitted leftover changes at the end, bucket them; do not leave a dirty working tree.

4. **Branch handling:**
   - Determine the primary branch: prefer `main`; if it does not exist, use `master`. If neither exists, stop and explain the blocker.
   - Ensure the commits land on the primary branch.
   - If already on `main` or `master`, stay there.
   - If on any other branch, switch to the primary branch before committing and pushing. Carry the working tree across only if it can be done safely.
   - If switching would discard work, introduce conflicts you cannot resolve confidently, or otherwise prevent a safe move onto the primary branch, stop and explain the blocker. Do not push the feature branch instead.

5. **Push and report:**
   - Push the resulting commits to the primary branch. `commit-and-push-by-feature` means commit and push when the workflow succeeds.
   - Output a concise summary: branch name, list of commits (hash + subject), confirmation that working tree is clean, and whether push was performed or blocked.

## Output Format

```
## Commits
| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| abc1234 | feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow |
| def5678 | docs(readme): update setup instructions |

Branch: current branch
Working tree: clean
```

## Constraints

- Do not amend or rewrite history unless explicitly asked.
- Do not commit secrets; if you detect likely secrets, stop and report before committing.
- If pre-commit hooks/tests fail, fix and retry.


## Alignment Page

When this skill prepares approval-gated durable planning, research, spec, task, prototype, report, or document deliverables, build a custom HTML alignment preview page at `alignment/commit-and-push-by-feature-{topic}.html` before asking the user to approve the canonical write; treat the HTML page as a review preview, not the canonical synthesized deliverable. Point the user to the page, summarize the recommended output and file changes, ask what questions or adjustments they have, and write or update the canonical files only after approval. For non-approval durable output writes, also build the custom HTML alignment page at `alignment/commit-and-push-by-feature-{topic}.html`. Use a normalized topic slug from the app, feature, research subject, report subject, or output filename. If the skill writes multiple scoped deliverables in one run, either write one alignment page per scope or one overview page that links each scope. Before replacing an existing alignment page, archive it to `docs/history/archive/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS/alignment/commit-and-push-by-feature-{topic}.html`. Attempt to open the resulting HTML page in the browser and report whether the browser open succeeded or was blocked. A blocked browser-open attempt does not make the skill fail when the files were written correctly.

## Default Shipping Contract

- **Default next-step routing:** when reporting completion, include either `Recommended next skill: <command>` or the two-line pair `**Next work:** <specific task or "none">` and `**Recommended next command:** <one command or route>` so the next operator has a concrete handoff.
- If this skill creates or modifies tracked repository files, finish by committing and pushing all intended changes to the repository primary branch (`main` when present, otherwise `master`) before stopping, even if the user did not explicitly ask for commit/push.
- Do not leave tracked changes or unpushed commits behind. If unrelated tracked work is already present, either include it in sensible commits too or stop and explain the blocker.
- This contract does not override stricter safety rules about secrets, destructive history changes, release publication/tag confirmation, or production deploy confirmation.
