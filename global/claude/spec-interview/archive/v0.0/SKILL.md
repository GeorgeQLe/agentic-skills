## Pack Availability Guard

Before telling the user to run a skill from another project-local pack, check `.agents/project.json.enabled_packs`. If the target pack is not enabled, recommend `/pack install <pack>` instead of the target skill. Global skills are always valid. Skills from this same pack are valid because the current skill is already running from that pack.

## Prototype Gate

Before starting the interview process, verify:

1. A consolidated prototype exists at `prototypes/{topic}/consolidated/`. If missing, halt and recommend `/consolidate-variations` first.
2. All research tasks from the `--post-prototype` pass are completed — check `tasks/todo.md` for unchecked items under `## Priority Documentation Todo` that reference post-prototype research. If unchecked post-prototype items remain, halt and recommend completing those first.

If both gates pass, proceed with the interview.

# Spec Interview

Interview the user to validate, refine, and complete an implementation specification from a consolidated prototype and research context. For half-formed product ideas, run `/concept-exploration` before this skill.

## Process

1. **Read consolidated prototype and research context:**
   - Read the consolidated prototype directory at `prototypes/{topic}/consolidated/` as the primary input. Walk through every screen, component, and interaction in the prototype to understand the current state.
   - If `.agents/project.json` exists, read `project_type` and `enabled_packs` before choosing a research frame.
   - For `business-app`, read `research/icp.md` when present and ground solution decisions against the ICP.
   - For `game`, read game research artifacts when present: `research/game-audience.md`, `research/game-fantasy.md`, `research/game-core-loop.md`.
   - For `devtool`, read devtool research artifacts when present: `research/devtool-user-map.md`, `research/devtool-dx-journey.md`, `research/devtool-integration-map.md`.
   - If project type is missing or mismatched, recommend `/pack recommend` or `/pack install <pack>` before doing domain-specific planning.
   - If `research/concept-brief.md`, `research/icp.md`, or `research/journey-map.md` exists in a business-app project, treat them as source evidence: does this implementation fit the concept constraints, user and customer journey, path to aha, conversion path, retention loop, champion dynamics, technical sophistication, and provisioning/onboarding model?
   - If lifecycle evidence is missing and the `customer-lifecycle` pack is not enabled, recommend `/pack install customer-lifecycle` before `/journey-map`.
   - When the user proposes something that conflicts with the ICP or journey map, flag it — e.g., "The journey map says the buyer needs a demo before sign-up — does this self-serve-only onboarding fit?"
   - Do not re-interview on concept, ICP, or journey topics already covered — focus on technical solution design.

2. **Surface a prototype-grounded assumptions checkpoint before probing:**
   - After reading the consolidated prototype and research context but **before** asking deep probing questions, present a concise **Assumptions Checkpoint** grounded in what the prototype reveals.
   - Tag each assumption with its source:
     - `[from spec]` — explicitly stated in the draft or spec document
     - `[from codebase]` — derived from reading existing code, config, or infrastructure
     - `[from research]` — derived from research docs (ICP, audience, journey maps)
     - `[from prototype]` — derived from the consolidated prototype
     - `[inferred]` — not stated anywhere; you filled in a default or made a judgment call
   - Keep the checkpoint short enough to preserve interview momentum: normally 3 to 7 bullets, grouped only when useful. Do not dump a comprehensive manifest unless the user explicitly asks to review assumptions first.
   - Bias the checkpoint toward assumptions that are uncertain, risky, contradicted by evidence, or likely to change data/API/architecture choices. Omit obvious restatements that can be captured later in the spec.
   - Focus the checkpoint on what the prototype assumes vs what production needs:
     - What the prototype assumes about **data model** — what's fake/fixture vs what needs real persistence
     - What the prototype assumes about **auth** — none? mock? real?
     - What **fake data needs to become real** — hardcoded lists, mock APIs, placeholder content
     - What **missing infrastructure** is needed — database, auth, payments, analytics, deployment
     - What **error/empty states** the prototype skips vs what production needs
   - Present the checkpoint with the first AskUserQuestion turn and immediately include 1 to 3 focused interview questions. Do not stop at the assumptions checkpoint unless the user explicitly asks to pause and review assumptions first.
   - If any `[inferred]` assumption is corrected, note the correction — these corrections are high-signal for downstream risk and must appear in the interview log.

3. **Screen-by-screen prototype walkthrough:**
   - Walk through each screen/page in the consolidated prototype. For each screen, use AskUserQuestion to probe:
     - **Data model?** What entities, relationships, persistence does this screen need?
     - **API calls?** What endpoints, payloads, error responses?
     - **Auth?** What permissions, roles, access control apply to this screen?
     - **Empty/error states?** What happens when data is missing, requests fail, or the user has no content yet?
     - **Performance?** Loading states, pagination, caching needs?
     - **Analytics?** What events should be tracked on this screen?
   - Ask one to three focused questions per turn.
   - **Research and recommend by default.** For each decision point, use web search, upstream research docs (`research/*.md`), and codebase analysis to gather evidence before asking the user. Present your findings with data, state your recommendation with reasoning, and ask the user to approve, adjust, or override. When a decision point genuinely has multiple viable approaches, list each option with a clear rationale, pros/cons, and your recommendation with reasoning. For the recommended option, explain how the con can be mitigated if feasible. Only ask the user to choose without a recommendation when the decision genuinely requires insider knowledge (internal constraints, personal preferences, strategic bets). Do not manufacture choices.

4. **Iterative prototype updates:**
   - When the interview reveals gaps in the prototype (missing screens, unclear flows, absent states), use AskUserQuestion: "Should I update the prototype to add [gap]? This may warrant re-running upstream steps."
   - The user decides per-update whether to update the prototype now or note it for production implementation only.
   - If the user approves a prototype update, make the change and note it in the interview log before continuing.

5. **Cover all areas:**
   - Continue until you have thoroughly covered: implementation goals, technical architecture, data models, APIs/contracts, migrations, edge cases, security, performance, observability, test strategy, and scope boundaries.
   - **Coverage checkpoint** — Before concluding, use AskUserQuestion to present a structured summary: list each area covered with the key decisions made and the evidence or reasoning that supported each decision. Then ask: "Does this cover everything? Any areas we should revisit or that I missed?"

6. **Write outputs:**
   - Write the completed specification to `specs/[topic].md` (create the `specs/` directory if it doesn't exist) where `topic` is a short kebab-case summary.
   - The spec must use these canonical section headings (unnumbered):
     - `## Overview`
     - `## Goals`
     - `## Non-Goals`
     - `## Detailed Design` (architecture, data models, APIs, UI flows)
     - `## Edge Cases`
     - `## Test Plan`
     - `## Acceptance Criteria`
     - `## Open Questions`
     - `## Assumptions & Risks` (the checkpoint output)
     Additional topic-specific sections (e.g. `## Data Model`, `## Security`) may appear between Detailed Design and Edge Cases. Do not number sections.
   - Append an **Assumptions & Risks** section to the end of the spec listing: each checkpoint assumption that was confirmed, corrected, or left unresolved during the interview, its source tag, and the downstream risk if the assumption turns out to be wrong later. Flag any `[inferred]` assumptions that were never explicitly confirmed by the user.
   - Create an interview log file named `[topic]-interview.md` recording each turn of the interview including questions asked, options presented with pros/cons, and user selections. The log must include the Assumptions Checkpoint as presented, user corrections, and a summary of significant deviations from the original spec.

## Output Format

Two files written:

- `specs/[topic].md` — the completed specification
- `[topic]-interview.md` — full interview log with deviation summary

### Alignment Page

When this skill produces durable deliverables (research, specs, plans, reports, prototypes, or any document output), build a full-depth HTML alignment page at `alignment/spec-interview-{topic}.html`. Use a normalized topic slug derived from the app, feature, research subject, report subject, or output filename.

**Full content requirement.** The alignment page must contain the complete content of every proposed markdown deliverable -- every section, every finding, every detail, every list item. It is a thorough interactive review document, not a summary. Render the full deliverable content in clean, readable HTML with appropriate hierarchy, styling, and navigation. If the skill writes multiple scoped deliverables in one run, build one alignment page that contains all deliverables with anchor-linked navigation. Durable tracker artifacts, such as `research/assumption-tracker.md`, remain canonical markdown outputs but must also be fully rendered into the alignment page before approval.

**Dark-mode styling.** Use a dark color scheme by default. Base CSS variables: `--bg: #0d1117; --surface: #161b22; --border: #30363d; --text: #c9d1d9; --text-muted: #8b949e; --accent: #58a6ff; --green: #3fb950; --red: #f85149; --orange: #d29922; --purple: #bc8cff;`. Apply `background: var(--bg); color: var(--text);` on body. Use `--surface` for cards, nav, and table headers. Use `--border` for all borders. Use `--purple` for question blocks and gate headings. Use `--accent` for links and section headings. Keep headings `color: #fff` or `var(--accent)` for hierarchy. Question block backgrounds should use `#1c2333`.

**Alignment gates.** Treat gates as explicit review sections inside the HTML page. A gate blocks finalization until its required inline questions are answered and compiled into YAML. Include every gate that applies to the skill output, and include these gate types whenever relevant: evidence coverage, assumptions/confidence, scope/non-goals, candidate/verdict decisions, artifact destination, proposed file changes, coverage checkpoint, and post-approval route.

**Report-only research gates.** For report-only or pre-approval research skills, the alignment page must explicitly contain evidence coverage, assumptions/confidence, recommended path, proposed file changes, and approval gates before any canonical research, spec, or task file is created or updated.

**Spec-specific gates.** Render surfaced assumptions, scope/non-goals, candidate decisions, acceptance coverage, artifact destination, proposed file changes, and post-approval route as gates before writing or replacing specs.


**Required inline questions.** Each gate must contain at least one required inline question placed directly under the content it governs, inside a visually distinct question block. Each question must use radio-button inputs and include two standing options after the skill-generated choices: "Other / None of the above" backed by a multi-line text box for free-form input, and "Need clarification" backed by an optional notes box where the user can explain what is unclear. When any radio option other than "Other" or "Need clarification" is selected, show an optional "Additional notes" text box beneath it so the user can qualify their choice. Generate questions based on what genuinely needs user input -- do not add filler questions. Do not create a separate bottom "Decisions & Clarifications" section.

**Gate YAML contract.** At the bottom of the page, include a "Compile Answers" button that aggregates answers from all inline gate questions throughout the page, including free-text notes. The button remains disabled until every required question has a selection, shows a count of remaining unanswered questions, and scrolls to the first unanswered question if clicked early. When every question is answered, generate a structured YAML block with one item per gate answer using this stable shape: `section`, `gate_type`, `status` (`answered`, `other`, or `needs-clarification`), `answer`, optional `notes`, and optional `target_artifact` or `target_path` when the gate controls file output. After successful compilation, automatically attempt to copy the YAML to the clipboard with the Clipboard API, display copy status, and display the YAML in a read-only textarea with an explicit "Copy YAML" button. The copy button must retry clipboard copy when supported and fall back to selecting the textarea contents when clipboard access is unavailable or blocked.

**Pre-approval stop.** Before user approval, the next action is review of the HTML alignment page, not downstream routing. Ask the user to review the page and provide the compiled YAML answers. Do not include `Recommended next skill`, `Recommended next command`, or downstream routing language until after compiled YAML has been provided and the approved artifacts have been written or updated.

**Diff highlighting on updates.** When the agent updates an existing alignment page after receiving compiled answers, highlight what changed since the previous version. The agent chooses inline annotation or side-by-side layout per situation.

**Archiving.** Before replacing an existing alignment page, archive it to `docs/history/archive/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS/alignment/spec-interview-{topic}.html`.

**Browser open.** Attempt to open the resulting HTML page in the browser and report whether the open succeeded or was blocked. A blocked browser-open attempt does not make the skill fail when the files were written correctly.

## Next-Step Routing

After writing the files, tell the user the next step based on available context: if research artifacts are stale or missing, run `/research-roadmap --post-spec`; otherwise run `/roadmap` to sequence specs into phases and seed Phase 1 implementation. Treat `/research-roadmap --post-spec` as the primary next route after a completed or updated spec when research gaps exist, and `/roadmap` as the default when research is current. Do not invoke the next skill automatically — the user may want to run multiple planning sessions first.

If the interview identifies follow-up work that is itself a named skill, recommend invoking that skill directly instead of phrasing it as another `/spec-interview` run. For example: say "run `/icp` and `/monetization`, then `/roadmap`" rather than "run `/spec-interview` for `/icp` and `/monetization`." This applies to research and planning skills such as `/icp`, `/monetization`, `/metrics`, `/positioning`, and `/competitive-analysis`. For these pack-based skills, apply the Pack Availability Guard — if the target skill's pack is not in `.agents/project.json` `enabled_packs`, recommend `/pack install <pack>` before the skill.

Before handing back, identify the next concrete work item from project state, then recommend the executor and invocation.

Output exactly two lines beyond the normal report:

- **Next work:** <specific planning, research, or execution task>
- **Recommended next command:** <one command or route>

Rules:

- Make the next work item primary. If follow-up research skills were identified, name those first. Use `/research-roadmap --post-spec` when research gaps were surfaced during the interview. Use `/roadmap` when research is current and the spec is ready for implementation sequencing.
- Use `./scripts/agent-mode.sh` only to choose command text. If it is missing, unset, or non-zero, infer routing from the current invocation and task type instead of asking the user to select a mode by default.
- Inference defaults:
  - Claude slash invocation (`/spec-interview`, `/roadmap`, `/delegate`) or orchestration-heavy work → recommend the matching `/...` route.
  - Codex skill invocation (`$spec-interview`, `$roadmap`) → recommend the matching `$...` command.
  - Manual or evidence-gathering work that needs browser access → recommend `/guide` or a Claude-guided manual step.
- Only present multiple commands when the ambiguity materially changes execution safety or there are equally valid next work items. Otherwise choose the best route and mention degraded mode lookup inline.

## Constraints

- Use AskUserQuestion for all interview turns — do not assume answers.
- One to three focused questions per turn, not more.
- Do not re-interview on ICP topics already covered in `research/icp.md`.
- Do not conclude the interview without explicit user confirmation that all areas are addressed.

## Ideas Mode (`--ideas`)

When `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--ideas`, read `tasks/ideas.md` and run the interview process for each idea sequentially.

### Process

1. Read `tasks/ideas.md` and extract every distinct idea entry. If `$ARGUMENTS` includes a filter keyword (beyond `--ideas`), limit to matching ideas.
2. Show the user the list and ask them to confirm, skip any, or reorder.
3. For each idea, run the standard interview process using the idea's title and description as the initial implementation draft. If an idea is still only a raw concept, route it to `/concept-exploration` first.
4. Write deliverables (`specs/[topic].md` and `[topic]-interview.md`) for each completed idea.
5. After each idea, summarize decisions and move to the next. The user may say "skip" to move on.

If the user stops partway through, write deliverables for completed ideas and note which remain.

## Archive-First Replacement Policy

- Before replacing or substantively rewriting an existing canonical research/spec document (`research/**/*.md`, `specs/**/*.md`, or `docs/specifications/**/*.md`), copy the current file to `docs/history/archive/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS/<original-relative-path>`.
- Preserve the archived snapshot exactly as it existed before the change; do not edit the archived copy after creating it.
- After the archive snapshot exists, write the updated document to the original canonical path.
- Report both the archive path and the updated canonical path in the final output.
- New files do not need archive snapshots. Append-only updates do not need archive snapshots unless an existing section is regenerated or rewritten.
- Keep any existing user approval requirement before overwriting or replacing a document; archiving does not replace asking when the skill already requires approval.

## Default Shipping Contract

- **Default next-step routing:** when reporting completion, include either `Recommended next skill: <command>` or the two-line pair `**Next work:** <specific task or "none">` and `**Recommended next command:** <one command or route>` so the next operator has a concrete handoff.
- If this skill creates or modifies tracked repository files, finish by committing and pushing all intended changes to the repository primary branch (`main` when present, otherwise `master`) before stopping, even if the user did not explicitly ask for commit/push.
- Do not leave tracked changes or unpushed commits behind. If unrelated tracked work is already present, either include it in sensible commits too or stop and explain the blocker.
- This contract does not override stricter safety rules about secrets, destructive history changes, release publication/tag confirmation, or production deploy confirmation.
