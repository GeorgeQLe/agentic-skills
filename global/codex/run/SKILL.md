# Run

Invoke as `$run`.

Identify the next incomplete unit of work from the phased plan, build an execution plan, implement it, ship the result, and prepare the next step. By default, executes only the next single incomplete step. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--phase`, execute the next full phase and ship once at the end.

## Workflow

1. **Migration check:** If `tasks/roadmap.md` does not exist but `tasks/todo.md` contains multiple `## Phase` headers, migrate: copy `tasks/todo.md` → `tasks/roadmap.md`, then trim `tasks/todo.md` to just the current phase (first phase with unchecked steps). Commit with `chore: migrate to roadmap.md + todo.md split`.
2. Read `tasks/todo.md` — this contains the current phase's steps. Reference `tasks/roadmap.md` only if cross-phase context is needed.
3. Read `CLAUDE.md` for project conventions.
3b. If `tasks/record-todo.md` or `tasks/recurring-todo.md` exists, count unchecked advisory items for status only. Do not select them as next work.
4. Find the next incomplete item:
   - Look for the next phase with an unchecked milestone.
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--phase`, scope the full next incomplete phase.
   - Otherwise, find the next unchecked `- [ ]` step within that phase.
   - **If the phase has acceptance criteria but no implementation steps** (no `### Tests First` or `### Implementation` section): invoke `$plan-phase` for this phase to generate implementation steps and file-level detail before proceeding.
5. **Check `tasks/manual-todo.md`** (if it exists) for unchecked items with `_(blocks: Step N.X)_` matching the current step. If a blocking external human-only manual task is found, stop and tell the user: "**Manual task blocking this step:** [task]. Complete it before proceeding, or run `$guide` for step-by-step instructions." Do NOT execute the step unless the manual task is completed or the user explicitly overrides the blocker. If the unchecked item is task-doc bookkeeping, reconciliation, or agent-executable work (repo edits, SDK wiring, local commands, tests, audits, generated assets, or authenticated CLI/API work), do not route it to `$guide`; route it to `$reconcile-dev-docs fix tasks`, promote it to `tasks/todo.md`, or handle it as a direct dev-doc audit.
6. Research what is needed — read only the files relevant to the step.
6b. Read the current phase's `### Execution Profile` from `tasks/todo.md` if present:
   - If missing, treat the phase as `serial`.
   - Use the profile only for the current step or scoped phase; do not plan ahead.
   - If the profile's `Parallel mode` is `agent-team`, stop before implementation and recommend running the work in Codex app worktrees or a Claude agent team rather than one shared local tree.
6c. **`--execute-approved` branch** (if `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--execute-approved`):
   - Reject `--execute-approved --phase` — approved packets target one step, not a full phase.
   - Run `scripts/approved-plan.sh check`.
   - On `ok`: run `scripts/approved-plan.sh consume`, log `Approved packet consumed: Phase X / Step Y (approved_at=…).`, then skip steps 7 and 8 and jump to step 9 (execute).
   - On non-zero exit: relay the single-line reason to the user, run `scripts/approved-plan.sh mark-stale`, then fall through to steps 7–8 (standard plan + implicit approval). Never auto-retry.
   - Requires `jq` for the write path. If `jq` is absent, `scripts/approved-plan.sh consume` dies with `ERROR: jq required for write operations. Install with: brew install jq (macOS) or apt install jq (Debian/Ubuntu).` (see `require_jq_write` at `scripts/approved-plan.sh:21`); `check` may surface the same message via its write-path preflight. Relay the message verbatim and stop — no `jq`-free fallback exists. If the check prints a `mode-mismatch` reason (resolved mode is `claude-only`), treat it as a user error and stop.
7. Present the execution plan to the user:
   - What the step requires
   - Which files will be created or modified
   - The approach and any trade-offs
   - Whether the execution profile will run serially, use read-only research lanes, use review lanes, or use disjoint write lanes
8. Use `update_plan` to track the proposed work, then execute by default. Do not ask for routine approval after presenting a `$run` plan; the user's `$run` invocation is implicit approval for the next planned step or scoped phase. Ask a concise confirmation question only when the work requires a separate safety decision: destructive commands, production deploys, paid/external account actions, credential or secret handling beyond the project contract, accepting an execution-profile downgrade, proceeding despite a blocker, or materially changing the planned scope.
9. Execute the plan:
   - Apply the execution profile:
     - `serial`: execute normally.
     - `research-only`: launch read-only subagent lanes first when the active environment permits subagents, synthesize their findings, then implement in the main agent.
     - `review-only`: implement in the main agent, then launch review subagent lanes before final validation.
     - `implementation-safe`: launch write subagent lanes only when every write lane has disjoint `Owns` paths and explicit `Must not edit` boundaries; otherwise downgrade to `research-only` or `serial` and report the downgrade.
     - `agent-team`: do not execute locally; report that the phase requires isolated worktrees or a dedicated agent team.
   - If it is a tests-first step: write the failing tests, run them to confirm they fail.
   - If it is an implementation step: implement it, run existing tests for regressions.
   - If it is a verification step: run all tests, fix any failures.
   - The main agent owns integration, conflict resolution, task doc updates, history updates, shipping, and deployment.
   - If a subagent touches files outside its owned paths or returns conflicting changes, stop and reconcile before validation.
10. Mark the completed work in `tasks/todo.md`:
   - Default mode: check off the completed step.
   - `--phase` mode: check off the completed steps and any acceptance criteria satisfied by the phase work.
11. **Pre-ship validation:**
   - First check conversation context for lint/typecheck/test/build output already produced this session. Do NOT re-run commands whose results are already available.
   - For any validation category not already run, find commands from: `CLAUDE.md`, `Makefile`/`Justfile` (check/lint/typecheck/test/build targets), `package.json` (lint/typecheck/check/test/build scripts), `pyproject.toml`/`setup.cfg`, `Cargo.toml`. If none found and no prior output exists, skip.
   - Inspect validation output even when commands exit zero. If warnings are emitted, either fix them, record them as explicitly accepted with rationale, or report them clearly as unresolved.
   - If errors are found (from prior output or fresh runs), fix them and re-run only the failing commands to confirm. Include fixes in the shipping commit, or a separate commit if unrelated.
   - If errors cannot be auto-fixed, **STOP. Do not ship.** Report the errors to the user and ask how to proceed. Never commit or push code with known build/lint/type/test failures.
12. Ship the completed work:
   - Update `tasks/history.md` with a brief record of what was accomplished. Create it if needed.
   - Commit and push using the `$commit-and-push-by-feature` workflow. That workflow must land the resulting commits on `main` or `master`, not on an existing feature branch.
13. Deploy:
   - Check for an explicit manual deploy contract in `deploy.md` or `tasks/deploy.md`.
   - If neither file exists, skip deploy and report `Deploy skipped: no explicit manual deploy contract (deploy.md or tasks/deploy.md)`.
   - If a deploy contract exists, read it first and use it to determine the deploy method.
   - Supplement the contract by checking: `spec.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tasks/roadmap.md`, `tasks/todo.md`, `Makefile`/`Justfile`, `package.json`, `deploy/`/`infra/`/`scripts/`, `docker-compose*.yml`.
   - Do NOT look in `.github/workflows/` — this project does not use GitHub Actions.
   - If a deploy contract exists but no deploy method is found, ask the user how deployment works. Do not guess.
   - Run the deploy and verify the output for errors.
   - Do not run `aws sso login` preemptively from stale context, old logs, or assumptions. If the deploy method uses an AWS profile and auth status is uncertain, first run `aws sts get-caller-identity --profile <profile>` using the profile from the deploy contract or deploy command.
   - If the AWS identity check succeeds, proceed directly with the deploy and do not run `aws sso login`.
   - If the AWS identity check or the deploy command fails because AWS SSO credentials are missing or expired, do not skip deployment. Run the matching `aws sso login --profile <profile>` command, using the profile from the deploy contract, deploy command, or error output.
   - When `aws sso login` prints a browser URL, device code, or verification instructions, relay them to the user and tell them to navigate to the provided URL and complete the login in their browser. Keep the login command running until it succeeds, fails, or times out.
   - After a successful SSO login, rerun the original deploy command once. This auth recovery is part of the same deploy attempt, not an automatic retry of a failed deploy.
   - If the user cannot complete SSO login or the login command fails, report the deploy as blocked by authentication. Do not report it as skipped.
   - If a health check URL or status command exists, run it.
   - If the deploy fails, report the error. Do not retry automatically.
14. Plan the next step:
   - Read `tasks/todo.md` to identify the next uncompleted step in the current phase.
   - **Check if the current phase is complete** (all steps checked, milestone criteria met):
     - If **YES — Phase transition:**
       1. Archive the completed phase: copy `tasks/todo.md` → `tasks/phases/phase-N.md` (create `tasks/phases/` if needed). Fill in the "On Completion" section.
       1b. If `tasks/manual-todo.md` exists, inspect unchecked items before advancing phases:
           - If any unchecked `_(blocks: Step N.X)_` items still apply to the completed phase, stop. Do NOT archive the manual task file, mark the phase complete, or advance to the next phase unless the user explicitly overrides the blocker.
           - Unchecked `_(after: Step N.X)_` items are non-blocking follow-up tasks. Archive them with the phase and warn the user that they remain incomplete.
       2. Check off the phase milestone in `tasks/roadmap.md`.
       3. Copy the next phase from `tasks/roadmap.md` → overwrite `tasks/todo.md`.
       3b. Extract the next phase's manual tasks (from `**Manual Tasks:**` in roadmap) into a fresh `tasks/manual-todo.md`. If the next phase has no manual tasks, delete the file.
       4. If no more phases remain, ship the planning/task updates via `$commit-and-push-by-feature`, landing them on `main` or `master`, then run `$research-roadmap` to recommend the next action based on project state. Then stop.
       5. **Just-in-time planning:** Invoke `$plan-phase` for the new phase. This generates implementation steps and file-level detail using the full context of what was learned during prior phases.
     - If **NO:** find the next uncompleted step within the current phase.
15. Write a self-contained implementation plan for the next step into `tasks/todo.md`, complete enough for a fresh session to execute from `tasks/todo.md` alone.
16. Ship `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/roadmap.md`, `tasks/manual-todo.md`, `tasks/record-todo.md`, `tasks/recurring-todo.md` (when they exist), and `tasks/phases/` (if created) via `$commit-and-push-by-feature`, landing them on `main` or `master`.

## Output

- Step or phase completed
- Files modified
- Deploy status (if deployed)
- Validation results (if lint/typecheck/test/build commands were run) — explicitly state whether failures are expected (red phase: tests before implementation) or unexpected (regressions/bugs), and call out any warnings as fixed, accepted, or unresolved
- Manual tasks — pending count from `tasks/manual-todo.md` (if it exists)
- Advisory tasks — pending record/recurring counts from `tasks/record-todo.md` and `tasks/recurring-todo.md` if they exist
- **Next work:** the next concrete project task, blocker, smoke test, or follow-up
- **Recommended next command:** one command or route for that work

## Next-Step Routing

Before handing back, identify the next concrete work item from project state, then recommend the executor and invocation.

Output exactly two lines beyond the normal report:

- **Next work:** <specific task name, manual blocker, verification gap, or "none">
- **Recommended next command:** <one command or route>

Rules:

- Make the next work item primary. Derive it from `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/manual-todo.md`, deploy status, validation gaps, smoke-test gaps, phase-transition output, or the absence of any remaining work. Do not use agent mode itself as the next work item.
- Use `./scripts/agent-mode.sh` only to choose command text. If it is missing, unset, or non-zero, infer routing from the current invocation and task type instead of asking the user to select a mode by default.
- Inference defaults:
  - Codex skill invocation (`$run`, `$ship`, `$ship-end`, or `$run --execute-approved`) → recommend the matching `$...` command.
  - Claude slash invocation (`/run`, `/ship`, `/delegate`) or orchestration-heavy work → recommend the matching `/...` route.
  - External human-only manual work (browser/auth/DNS/service dashboard work with no reliable authenticated CLI/API path, paid account setup, real-device checks, or production smoke-test work needing human sign-off) → recommend `$guide` or a Claude-guided manual step rather than `$run`.
  - Agent-executable work misfiled in `tasks/manual-todo.md`, task-doc bookkeeping, stale `tasks/manual-todo.md` cleanup, or reconciliation against repo/history reality → recommend `$reconcile-dev-docs fix tasks`, promotion to `tasks/todo.md`, or a direct dev-doc audit, not `$guide`.
  - Approved packet present → recommend `$run --execute-approved` unless the resolved mode is explicitly `claude-only`.
- Only present multiple commands when the ambiguity materially changes execution safety or there are equally valid next work items. Otherwise choose the best route and mention degraded mode lookup inline.

### Pack-Aware Command Text

After resolving or inferring the command route, resolve enabled packs via `./scripts/pack.sh list-packs` (newline-separated enabled pack names from `.agents/project.json.enabled_packs`; reuses the `read_enabled_packs` reader — do not grep `.agents/project.json` directly). When the recommendation would emit `$run`, `$ship`, or `$ship-end`, check whether any enabled pack ships the matching `-kanban` variant (`run-kanban`, `ship-kanban`, `ship-end-kanban`) under `packs/<pack>/codex/`. If one does, emit the kanban invocation (e.g., `$run-kanban`) in place of the global default. Candidates today are `business-app-kanban`, `devtool-kanban`, `game-kanban`, and `poketowork-kanban` — each tagged `Both` in `docs/operating-modes.md` § "Pack emphasis" with kanban `run`/`ship`/`ship-end` execution variants.

- **No-match / no-pack:** emit the global-default recommendation exactly as today. No "I checked enabled_packs" noise.
- **Degraded path:** missing or malformed `.agents/project.json` (or non-zero exit from `list-packs`) → silent fallback to the global-default recommendation with a single inline comment `pack-lookup: skipped (no project.json)` appended to the recommendation line.
- **Ambiguity:** if two enabled packs both ship the same `-kanban` variant, recommend the first in `enabled_packs` order and note the tie inline. Do not prompt.
- **Scope:** recommendation-text routing only. `$run --execute-approved` still consumes `.agents/approved-plan.json` verbatim regardless of pack routing — the approval-packet contract is unchanged.

## Constraints

- One step at a time by default, or one phase with `--phase`. Then stop and let the user decide what is next.
- `--execute-approved` consumes an `approved` packet at `.agents/approved-plan.json` (contract in `docs/operating-modes.md` § "Approval packet"). `--execute-approved --phase` is rejected — packets target one step. In `claude-only` mode the flag is a user error; Codex is not the executor. Requires `jq` on PATH.
- Always present the plan before executing, then proceed by default under implicit approval. Do not assume a Claude-style `EnterPlanMode` or clear-context accept flow exists.
- Ask for explicit confirmation only for separate safety decisions, and ask one concise question when that is needed. Avoid back-to-back variants like "Approve and I'll run..." followed by a second restatement of the same action.
- Keep context footprint minimal — only read files relevant to the current step.
- If a blocker prevents completion, document it in `tasks/todo.md` and stop.
- Follow the test strategy annotated on each phase. Do not skip test steps for `tdd` phases.
- Follow the `### Execution Profile` annotated on each phase. If subagents are unavailable in the active environment, execute serially and report the downgrade.
- Do not let subagents update `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/roadmap.md`, `tasks/history.md`, shipping commits, or deploy steps. Those remain main-agent responsibilities.
- Do not run parallel write lanes unless their `Owns` paths are disjoint. When in doubt, downgrade to `research-only` or `serial`.
- Do not push shipping commits to an existing feature branch. Use `$commit-and-push-by-feature` to move the work onto `main` or `master` and push it there, or stop and report a blocker if that cannot be done safely.
- Do NOT execute external human-action items from `tasks/manual-todo.md`. Bookkeeping or agent-executable items that were misfiled there should be reconciled through `$reconcile-dev-docs` or promoted into `tasks/todo.md`, not routed to `$guide`.
- Do NOT execute items from `tasks/record-todo.md` or `tasks/recurring-todo.md` unless the item has first been promoted into `tasks/todo.md`.
- `run` ships by default in Codex. Use `$ship` only when there is already finished work in the tree or unpushed commits that need packaging without running a new step.
- Never use GitHub Actions for deployment. Only use manual deploy scripts, Makefiles, or CLI commands.
- Never deploy to production without explicit user confirmation.
- Do not modify code as part of the deploy process.

## Default Shipping Contract

- If this skill creates or modifies tracked repository files, finish by committing and pushing all intended changes to the repository primary branch (`main` when present, otherwise `master`) before stopping, even if the user did not explicitly ask for commit/push.
- Do not leave tracked changes or unpushed commits behind. If unrelated tracked work is already present, either include it in sensible commits too or stop and explain the blocker.
- This contract does not override stricter safety rules about secrets, destructive history changes, release publication/tag confirmation, or production deploy confirmation.
