# Investigate

Invoke as `$investigate`.

Use this skill when the user reports a bug, error, unexpected behavior, or provides observations/hypotheses about what they think is wrong. Validates claims against the codebase and git history before tracing to root cause.

## Workflow

1. Parse the error message, stack trace, bug description, or user observations/claims.
2. **Select investigation strategy** from flags or auto-detection:
   - `--ui`: Visual/layout bugs — start from component tree, styles, animations, transitions, spacing, theming, skeleton/loading states, positioning. Signal words: skeleton, animation, spacing, popover, transition, theme, truncated, glitch, dead space, detached, pop-in, flickering, layout, z-index, overflow.
   - `--data`: Data/state bugs — start from data pipeline, state management, timers, counters, sync logic. Signal words: countdown, percentage, usage, sync, stale, timer, refresh, reset, missing data, wrong number, out of sync, not updating, mismatch.
   - General (default): Errors, crashes, behavioral bugs, and anything ambiguous — start from symptom/stack trace.
   - If input has signals from both UI and data, prefer data strategy — wrong data commonly manifests as a visual symptom.
3. If the user provides claims or hypotheses, validate each one against the codebase and git history (`git log`, `git diff`, `git blame`). Classify each as confirmed, partially correct, or not supported by evidence. Report findings before proceeding.
4. Trace using the selected strategy:
   - **UI**: component tree → styles → layout → animation/transition → render lifecycle. Check CSS conflicts, missing keys, layout thrashing, transition timing.
   - **Data**: data source → transform → store → subscription → render. Check stale closures, missing dependency arrays, incorrect comparisons, cache invalidation, timer drift.
   - **General**: execution path from symptom to source — null/undefined, wrong types, missing env vars, stale imports, race conditions, schema mismatches.
   - If the initial strategy hits a dead end, pivot to the other — a UI bug may have a data root cause, and vice versa.
5. Check recent git history for changes that may have introduced the issue.
6. Identify the root cause with file and line reference.
7. Apply a minimal fix and write or update tests.
8. Run tests to verify the fix and check for regressions.

## Output Format

- **Strategy Used**: UI / Data / General (auto-detected or flag-forced), whether a pivot occurred
- **User Claims Validated**: For each claim — verdict (confirmed/partially correct/not supported) and evidence. Skip if input was a plain error message.
- **Root Cause**: file:line, what's wrong, when introduced, relationship to user's theory
- **Fix Applied**: files modified, test results
- **Prevention**: what check would have caught this earlier

## Constraints

- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Validate user claims before assuming they're correct — observations are a starting point, not ground truth.
- If the root cause can't be determined, report what was ruled out.
- Always run tests after applying the fix.


## Default Shipping Contract

- **Default next-step routing:** when reporting completion, include either `Recommended next skill: <command>` or the two-line pair `**Next work:** <specific task or "none">` and `**Recommended next command:** <one command or route>` so the next operator has a concrete handoff.
- If the investigation applied a fix, validated it, committed it, pushed it, and confirmed the tree is clean with no unpushed commits, end with exactly `**Next work:** none` and `**Recommended next command:** none`.
- Do not recommend `$ship-end` after a clean, already-pushed investigation unless there are pending docs, uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, deploy follow-up, unresolved wrap-up work, or a project task source explicitly points to `$ship-end`.
- If this skill creates or modifies tracked repository files, finish by committing and pushing all intended changes to the repository primary branch (`main` when present, otherwise `master`) before stopping, even if the user did not explicitly ask for commit/push.
- Do not leave tracked changes or unpushed commits behind. If unrelated tracked work is already present, either include it in sensible commits too or stop and explain the blocker.
- This contract does not override stricter safety rules about secrets, destructive history changes, release publication/tag confirmation, or production deploy confirmation.
