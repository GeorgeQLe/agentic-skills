# Expert Review

Invoke as `$expert-review`.

Use this skill when the user wants a code review of the whole project or a specific path, with findings validated against project documentation.

## Workflow

1. Gather project context:
   - Read CLAUDE.md, README, and project config to understand conventions.
   - Search for and read specs (`specs/`, `spec.md`, `docs/`), changelogs (`CHANGELOG.md`, `tasks/history.md`), ADRs, interview logs (`*-__interview.md__`), and design docs.
   - Read `tasks/roadmap.md` if it exists to understand the full plan. Read `tasks/todo.md` for current phase and in-progress work. Read `tasks/manual-todo.md` (if it exists) for pending manual tasks. Read `tasks/record-todo.md` and `tasks/recurring-todo.md` (if they exist) for advisory context only.
   - Build a mental model of intentional decisions and documented trade-offs.
2. If the user provides a file or directory, scope the review there. Otherwise review the repository broadly.
3. Read enough of the codebase to understand the architecture before critiquing it.
4. Review against these dimensions:
   - Correctness
   - Security
   - Performance
   - Architecture
   - Error handling
   - Code quality
   - Testing
   - Dependency risks
   - Spec conformance — code that diverges from documented specs or design decisions
5. Cross-reference each finding against documentation before reporting:
   - If a pattern is an intentional documented decision, do not report it as an issue — list it under "Documented decisions" instead.
   - If code diverges from a spec, flag it as a spec conformance issue.
6. Verify findings (false-positive filter):
   - Re-read the actual source code for every finding. Confirm: the code behaves as claimed, the issue isn't handled elsewhere (guard clause, middleware, caller), flagged dependencies actually exist/are missing, and "missing" test coverage isn't in a different test file.
   - Drop any finding you cannot re-confirm on second read. If uncertain, downgrade to Low with a note that it needs manual verification.

## Output Format

Report findings grouped by severity:

- Critical: bugs, security issues, data-loss risks
- High: major performance, architecture, or error-handling problems
- Medium: maintainability or testing gaps with real impact
- Low: worthwhile improvements with limited risk
- Spec conformance: where code diverges from documented specs, with document reference
- Documented decisions (no action needed): patterns that look like issues but are intentional
- Positive observations: strong patterns worth preserving

## Follow-Through

After presenting findings, write Critical and High implementation fixes to `tasks/todo.md` under a `## Code Review Fixes` heading (append or replace existing section). One checkbox per finding with file:line and recommended fix. Do not add Medium/Low items. If a Critical/High observation is a non-blocking future validation or condition-gated measurement rather than a fix, write it to `tasks/record-todo.md` with source, condition, non-blocking reason, evidence, and promotion rule. Suggest `$run` or `$investigate` to start fixing concrete work.

## Constraints

- Include concrete file and line references for each finding when possible.
- Every finding should include a specific recommended fix.
- Do not fill the review with style nitpicks.
- Never flag an intentional design decision as an issue. Respect documented trade-offs.
- If no project documentation exists, note the absence and recommend establishing specs or ADRs.


## Alignment Page

When this skill prepares approval-gated durable planning, research, spec, task, prototype, report, or document deliverables, build a custom HTML alignment preview page at `alignment/expert-review-{topic}.html` before asking the user to approve the canonical write; treat the HTML page as a review preview, not the canonical synthesized deliverable. Point the user to the page, summarize the recommended output and file changes, ask what questions or adjustments they have, and write or update the canonical files only after approval. For non-approval durable output writes, also build the custom HTML alignment page at `alignment/expert-review-{topic}.html`. Use a normalized topic slug from the app, feature, research subject, report subject, or output filename. If the skill writes multiple scoped deliverables in one run, either write one alignment page per scope or one overview page that links each scope. Before replacing an existing alignment page, archive it to `docs/history/archive/YYYY-MM-DD/HHMMSS/alignment/expert-review-{topic}.html`. Attempt to open the resulting HTML page in the browser and report whether the browser open succeeded or was blocked. A blocked browser-open attempt does not make the skill fail when the files were written correctly.

## Default Shipping Contract

- **Default next-step routing:** when reporting completion, include either `Recommended next skill: <command>` or the two-line pair `**Next work:** <specific task or "none">` and `**Recommended next command:** <one command or route>` so the next operator has a concrete handoff.
- If this skill creates or modifies tracked repository files, finish by committing and pushing all intended changes to the repository primary branch (`main` when present, otherwise `master`) before stopping, even if the user did not explicitly ask for commit/push.
- Do not leave tracked changes or unpushed commits behind. If unrelated tracked work is already present, either include it in sensible commits too or stop and explain the blocker.
- This contract does not override stricter safety rules about secrets, destructive history changes, release publication/tag confirmation, or production deploy confirmation.
