# Ship

Ship already-finished work, commit it, optionally deploy it, and plan the next step. In Codex, `$run` usually handles execution plus shipping; use `$ship` when finished work is already present in the tree or there are unpushed commits to package. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--no-plan`, skip planning. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--no-deploy`, skip deployment.

## Workflow

1. Check if there is anything to ship:
   - Run `git status` and `git diff --stat`.
   - If the working tree is clean and there are no unpushed commits, skip to step 3.
   - If there are changes, continue to step 2.
1b. **Pre-ship error check:**
   - First check conversation context for lint/typecheck/test output already produced this session (e.g., from a TDD run step). Do NOT re-run commands whose results are already available.
   - For any validation category not already run, find commands from: `CLAUDE.md`, `Makefile`/`Justfile` (check/lint/typecheck/test targets), `package.json` (lint/typecheck/check/test scripts), `pyproject.toml`/`setup.cfg`, `Cargo.toml`. If none found and no prior output exists, skip.
   - If pre-existing errors are found (from prior output or fresh runs), fix them and re-run only the failing commands to confirm. Include fixes in the step's commit (or as a separate commit if unrelated).
   - If errors can't be auto-fixed, **STOP. Do not ship.** Report the errors to the user and ask how to proceed. Never commit or push code with known build/lint/type/test failures.
2. Ship the work:
   - Read `CLAUDE.md` to understand current progress.
   - Update `tasks/todo.md` — mark completed items as done.
   - Update `tasks/history.md` — append a brief record of what was accomplished. Create it if needed.
   - Commit and push using the `$commit-and-push-by-feature` workflow. That workflow must land the resulting commits on `main` or `master`, not on an existing feature branch.
3. Deploy (skip if `--no-deploy`):
   - Check for an explicit manual deploy contract in `deploy.md` or `tasks/deploy.md`.
   - If neither file exists, skip deploy and report `Deploy skipped: no explicit manual deploy contract (deploy.md or tasks/deploy.md)`.
   - If a deploy contract exists, read it first and use it to determine the deploy method.
   - Supplement the contract by checking: `spec.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tasks/roadmap.md`, `tasks/todo.md`, `Makefile`/`Justfile`, `package.json`, `deploy/`/`infra/`/`scripts/`, `docker-compose*.yml`.
   - Do NOT look in `.github/workflows/` — this project does not use GitHub Actions.
   - If a deploy contract exists but no deploy method is found, ask the user how deployment works. Do not guess.
   - Run the deploy and verify the output for errors.
   - If a health check URL or status command exists, run it.
   - If the deploy fails, report the error. Do not retry automatically.
4. Plan the next step:
   - **Migration check:** If `tasks/roadmap.md` does not exist but `tasks/todo.md` contains multiple `## Phase` headers, migrate: copy `tasks/todo.md` → `tasks/roadmap.md`, then trim `tasks/todo.md` to just the current phase (first phase with unchecked steps). Commit with `chore: migrate to roadmap.md + todo.md split`.
   - Read `tasks/todo.md` to identify the next uncompleted step in the current phase.
   - **Check if the current phase is complete** (all steps checked, milestone criteria met):
     - If **YES — Phase transition:**
       1. Archive the completed phase: copy `tasks/todo.md` → `tasks/phases/phase-N.md` (create `tasks/phases/` if needed). Fill in the "On Completion" section.
       1b. If `tasks/manual-todo.md` exists, archive it to `tasks/phases/phase-N-manual.md`. Warn (but do not block) if unchecked manual tasks remain.
       2. Check off the phase milestone in `tasks/roadmap.md`.
       3. Copy the next phase from `tasks/roadmap.md` → overwrite `tasks/todo.md`.
       3b. Extract the next phase's manual tasks (from `**Manual Tasks:**` in roadmap) into a fresh `tasks/manual-todo.md`. If the next phase has no manual tasks, delete the file.
       4. If no more phases remain, run `$workflow` to recommend the next action based on project state. Then stop.
       5. **Just-in-time planning:** Invoke `$plan-phases` for the new phase. This generates implementation steps and file-level detail using the full context of what was learned during prior phases.
     - If **NO:** find the next uncompleted step within the current phase.
5. Write a self-contained implementation plan for the next step into `tasks/todo.md`, complete enough for a fresh session to execute from `tasks/todo.md` alone.
6. Ship `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/roadmap.md`, `tasks/manual-todo.md` (if it exists), and `tasks/phases/` (if created) via `$commit-and-push-by-feature`, landing them on `main` or `master`.
7. Output a brief summary:
   - What was shipped (if anything)
   - Deploy status (if deployed)
   - Test status — explicitly state whether any failing tests are expected (red phase: tests before implementation) or unexpected (regressions/bugs)
   - Manual tasks — pending count from `tasks/manual-todo.md` (if it exists), note any blocking upcoming steps
   - What the next step is

## Constraints

- **Fix unrelated issues:** If any step surfaces errors, warnings, or lint issues — even ones unrelated to the current work — investigate and fix them before continuing. Commit these fixes separately with a descriptive message (e.g., `fix: resolve unused import warning in auth.ts`).
- Do not write plans into `CLAUDE.md`. It is for project conventions only.
- `tasks/roadmap.md` is the source of truth for the full phased plan. `tasks/todo.md` holds only the current phase.
- Create `tasks/todo.md` if it does not exist.
- Do not amend or rewrite history.
- Do not commit secrets.
- Do not push shipping commits to an existing feature branch. Use `$commit-and-push-by-feature` to move the work onto `main` or `master` and push it there, or stop and report a blocker if that cannot be done safely.
- The plan must be actionable with specific file paths and technical details.
- In Codex, `$ship` is a compatibility/manual cleanup workflow. Prefer `$run` for the normal execute-and-ship loop.
- `ship` only runs a deploy when `deploy.md` or `tasks/deploy.md` explicitly documents a manual deployment workflow. Repos without one are assumed to auto-deploy or require no manual deploy step.
- Never use GitHub Actions for deployment. Only use manual deploy scripts, Makefiles, or CLI commands.
- Never deploy to production without explicit user confirmation.
- Do not modify code as part of the deploy process.

## Kanban Mode (`--kanban`)

When `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--kanban`, perform kanban operations during the ship workflow.

### Kanban Setup

1. Resolve the board: check `tasks/.kanban-board` for stored ID, validate via `poketo kanban board <id>`. If missing, match board names against `basename $(pwd)`. If no match, ask the user.
2. Validate all 5 lists exist (Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done, Punt). Create missing ones via `poketo kanban create-list`.
3. If the poketo CLI is missing or the gateway is unreachable, warn and continue without kanban.

All kanban commands use: `poketo kanban <command>`

### After Shipping — Move Completed Card

1. Find the completed step's card on the board.
2. Step checked off → move to Done + `done --id`. Step has blocker/deferred → move to Punt + add reason. Unclear → ask the user. If in Plan mode, prefer `request_user_input`.
3. Update card description with commit SHAs.

### After Planning — Ensure Next Card in Todo

1. Search for next step's card.
2. If in Backlog → move to Todo. If not found → create in Todo. If already in Todo or later → skip.

### Next Work Suggestion

Suggest the top Todo card by priority (overdue > starred > list order). If no Todo cards, check Backlog. If nothing: "Board is clear."

Kanban operations are additive — if any kanban command fails, warn and continue. Core workflow must succeed.
