# Spec Interview Kanban

Use this skill only in projects that have opted into a PoketoWork kanban pack.

## Process

1. Follow the base `/spec-interview` workflow exactly, passing through `$ARGUMENTS` as the topic, draft, or spec path.
2. Resolve and validate the project board:
   - Check `tasks/.kanban-board`, then validate with `poketo kanban board <id>`.
   - If missing or stale, match `poketo kanban boards` against `basename $(pwd)`.
   - If no board is clear, ask the user. If no boards exist, offer `poketo kanban create-board --name "$(basename $(pwd))" --template standard`.
   - Ensure Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done, and Punt lists exist.
3. Fetch the board and show a brief overview before the interview.
4. After the base interview writes the spec and interview log:
   - Extract two or three distinctive keywords from the topic or spec title.
   - Search all lists for matching cards.
   - If one card matches, update that card description with the spec summary and file path. Do not move it.
   - If multiple cards match, ask the user which card to update.
   - If no card matches, create a Backlog card with the spec summary and file path.
5. Report the card updated or created.

Never move cards backward from Done or Punt. If kanban fails, warn and keep the completed spec as the source of truth.
